		<div class="seasonName">Season 2</div>
			Season 2 is going to require a healthy dose of suspension of disbelief, because the show has reused the same actors from season one to play entirely different parts. You remember Soji? Well, she's Kore now. A completley unrelated, non-android character. And Laris? She'll be playing Tallinn. And Brent Spiner will be back as Yetanother Soong. Got it? Great.
			<br><br>
			This season does some serious time-bending alternate-universe type stuff, which is of course all thanks to Q, an omnipotent being and constant thorn in Picard's side.
			<br><br>
			Again, you do <span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span> need to watch anything before enjoying Season 2 of <em>Picard</em>, but you might enjoy it a little bit more if you know some of the background. Below is a suggested watch-list to consider before watching this season, or maybe you'd rather come back to this list afterwards.

							Over a year has passed since the Federation lifted the ban on synths. Picard, Rios, Raffi, and Elnor settle into new roles at Starfleet while Seven returns to mercenary work, Soji hosts posh synth parties, and Jurati gets drunk. Picard visits Guinan at 10 Forward Avenue for a drink, lamenting that he never found time for love. Earlier, he had had a flashback to his childhood where apparently his parents fought both verbally and physically. His mother, wanting more for him, tells Jean-Luc to &ldquo;look up&rdquo; at the stars as they stand in their new château's solarium. Back in the present, a very strange spatial anomaly opens up and asks for Picard's help, which gets the whole gang back together. Well, except for Soji.<span class="spoilerContent"> It's the Borg. They say they want to join the Federation, but they also start assimilating everything in sight. Picard orders the ship to auto-destruct, and then he wakes up back at his château, but he's wearing a bizzaro Starfleet badge and there's weird hexagons in the sky. Everything has changed, somehow, and finally Q appears to tell Picard that &ldquo;the trial never ends.&rdquo;</span>

								One of the very first things we see in this episode is what I like to call, &ldquo;the hallway.&rdquo; It's an interior corridor of a Starfleet ship, and it will be used over and over and over again, especially in Season 3. It will be shot from different angles, sometimes it will have boxes or other props in it, other times it will be empty, but it will always be the same hallway, and now you won't be able to un-see it, either.
								<br><br>
								And oh look, Rios and Jurati have broken up. Well, that was short-lived. Still, Jurati gets to come along for the ride because nothing says &ldquo;spatial anomaly expert&rdquo; like &ldquo;cyberneticist&rdquo;? We get a brief scene to remind us that Soji still exists, but that will be the last we see of her this season. Don't worry, though, there will be a brand new character later who looks <em>suspiciously</em> just like her!
								<br><br>
								There's a lot happening in this first episode. After establishing what our characters have been up to for the last year and a half, Picard gives a speech to Starfleet cadets in a large auditorium, he visits our old friend Guinan, he has some sort of flashback to his childhood with his mother, the Borg are here causing trouble, and of course there's Q. Wow! Knowing that Q was going to appear this season, I think a lot of people assumed that he would just snap his fingers to look older as a favor to Picard, and that's precisely what he did. Since Q is ageless, this was a quick and easy way to hang a lampshade as an explanation for why Q appears to have aged, since obviously the actor has aged in the almost 30 years since his last appearance as Q. There is only a moment where he appears as his original self, with heavy CGI manipulation to de-age him. To keep costs to a minimum, this lasts only a few seconds while Q remains in one position without a lot of movement, so we only see him from the one straight-on angle. A snap of the fingers later, and John de Lancie can continue to play the character without futher need for de-aging techniques. I think the fans accepted it willingly.

								<li>Picard attributes the line, &ldquo;Look up, and let's see what's out there&rdquo; to his mother. Picard's final line in the series premiere of <em>The Next Generation</em>, <a href="../tng/tng-s1.html#e01">TNG 1x01: Encounter at Farpoint</a>, is &ldquo;Let's see what's out there.

								<li>Picard says he is looking to make changes to the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru_scenario" target="_blank">Kobayashi Maru</a>, an infamous test for Starfleet cadets that assesses their ability to cope with a no-win scenario. It's established in <a href="../films/thewrathofkhan.html"><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em></a> that James Kirk famously beat the test by reprogramming the scenario. Said Kirk, &ldquo;I don't like to lose.&rdquo;</li>
								<li>When Picard beams to Los Angeles to visit Guinan at her bar, he first looks at the street sign for &ldquo;Forward Ave&rdquo; and then walks to the bar, which is number 10 on that street.

								<li>Picard activates the auto-destruct program with authorization code &ldquo;zero-zero-zero-destruct-zero.&rdquo; This is the same code used by James Kirk in <a href="../films/thesearchforspock.html"><em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em></a>.</li>
								<li>&ldquo;Mon capitaine&rdquo; is Q's long-time nickname for Picard, and &ldquo;the trial never ends&rdquo; is a reference to the final episode of <em>The Next Generation</em>, <a href="../tng/tng-s7.html#e25">TNG 7x25: All Good Things…</a>.</li>

								<li>About 13 minutes into the episode, when Picard is looking for a book and Laris enters, there is a stone tablet sitting on the table that looks remarkably like the Reckoning Tablet from <a href="../ds9/ds9-s6.html#e21">DS9 6x21: The Reckoning</a>, which is notably an unresolved story. The tablet is also prominently visible in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk9F90wklRQ" target="_blank">Season 2 Teaser</a>. However, the tablet is never referenced, nor does it have anything to do with the story. It is mere <em>mise en scène</em>. This makes me wonder if the prop was used intentionally as a red herring for eagle-eyed viewers, or if it was just something in the prop archives that a set designer thought would make an interesting centerpiece, without understanding its origin.</li>
								<li>When Picard enters the bar, Guinan starts to talk to him without even turning around. This could be a hint at Guinan's &ldquo;sixth sense&rdquo; about things... orrrrr it could just be that she saw his reflection in the mirrored wall behind the bar. Ha!</li>
								<li>I can't stop laughing at Rios running back to his captain's chair when the crisis starts. There's just something comical about it, like he can't run the ship unless he's in the chair or something.</li>

								This episode feels a lot like the evil &ldquo;Mirror Universe,&rdquo; but it's actually just our universe that has been changed because of something that Q altered in the past. In this version of events, Picard has become a ruthless general in a xenophobic regime. This is the second time that <em>Trek</em> has floated the idea that &ldquo;if things had just been a little different&rdquo; Picard would grow up to be some sort of monster. The first time was <a href="../films/nemesis.html"><em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em></a> where a clone of Picard was subjected to cruel conditions growing up, and he turned out to be pretty evil. I'm all for exploring this idea of nature versus nurture, but I think at this point the writers are just suggesting that it's pure luck that in the Prime Timeline/Universe, Picard has grown to be a morally-centered, skilled diplomat.
								<br><br>
								Anyway, it's kind of fun to see everyone coping with this new reality and coming together to formulate a plan, but I think Jurati's &ldquo;comedy relief&rdquo; is over the top and pulls us out of the story. It might have been more realistic if someone had just said &ldquo;shut up&rdquo; during her long, rambling explanation. There's another few instances where it feels a little implausible that our heroes somehow managed to blend in so quickly without raising suspicion, but let's just say that Q quietly helped them along the way and move on.
								<span class="spoilerContent"><br><br>
								Here we have an introduction of another Borg Queen (sans legs) who Picard is expected to execute on stage at the Eradication Day ceremony. This takes place in the same auditorium where Picard delivered his speech in the previous episode, but this version is much darker and emblazoned with red flags and spotlights, because we all know that in film and television, red equals evil! Finally, the gang make their escape but, oopsie! Someone got shot!</span>

He also says, &ldquo;Through a mirror darkly, and here the man who holds the glass is darker still,&rdquo; likely a Biblical reference to 1 Corinthians 13:12, &ldquo; <sup>12</sup>For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.&rdquo; This also references episode titles <a href="../ent/ent-s4.html#e18">ENT 4x18 &amp; 4x19: In a Mirror, Darkly</a> and <a href="../ds9/ds9-s3.html#e19">DS9 3x19: Through the Looking Glass</a>.

								<li>As Q tours the skulls in Picard's menagerie, he points out Gul Dukat and General Martok, both prominent characters from <a href="../ds9/index.html"><em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em></a>. Next, he points out Sarek, Spock's father. Also among them is a Ferengi skull, the pedestal adorned with the top of the staff of the Grand Nagus. The skull likely belongs to Grand Nagus Zek, also from <a href="../ds9/index.html"><em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em></a>.
								<li>In evil-Picard’s recorded speech he says, &ldquo;We sought out and subjugated savage civilizations, boldly conquered war-like alien worlds, increased the wealth and resources for future generations of humanity.&rdquo; This is a play on the preamble from The Original Series and The Next Generation: &ldquo;To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.&rdquo;</li>
								<li>General Sisko is mentioned, presumably this reality's version of Benjamin Sisko.</li>
								<li>The Borg Queen calls Seven &ldquo;Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01,&rdquo; which is part of her original full Borg designation as defined in her first appearance in <a href="../voy/voy-s4.html#e01">VOY 4x01: Scorpion, Part II</a>.</li>
								<li>Raffi calls Q &ldquo;Mister Alphabet,&rdquo; possibly a reference to <a href="../tng/tng-s7.html#e25">TNG 7x25/26: All Good Things…</a>, in which an alternate Tasha Yar doesn't understand why Picard is yelling &ldquo;Q!&rdquo; when, as far as she knows, it's only a letter of the alphabet.</li>
								<li>Picard speaks of a slingshot maneuver used on more than one occasion by Kirk's Enterprise  to effect time travel. Indeed, the maneuver was used at least three times, in <a href="../tos/tos-s1.html#e21">TOS 1x21: Tomorrow is Yesterday</a>, <a href="../tos/tos-s2.html#e26">TOS: Assignment: Earth</a>, and <a href="../films/iv-tvh.html"><em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</em></a>.

								<p>Except for the last two minutes, I rather like this episode. I think the interaction between Picard and the younger Guinan (portrayed by the delightful <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ito_Aghayere" target="_blank">Ito Aghayere</a>) is wonderful, especially the emotional part where Guinan laments the shortcomings of 2024 Earth in a way that certainly hits close to home. I'm also a fan of the car chase. It's certainly not something we get to see in <em>Trek</em>... well, ever. The closest thing to it was the dune buggy chase in <em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em>, but that one felt out of place and gratuitous. I think any time Star Trek gets an opportunity to work in the &ldquo;present&rdquo; that they should absolutely take advantage of any opportunities to do things they couldn't normally do, and it was a lot of fun to watch Raffi and Seven in such unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
								<p>Also hitting close to home are the scenes with the overzealous and racist ICE agents. With current events how they are as I write this in 2025, it seems like <em>Trek</em> was only one year off in their predictions about the agency. Picard's message to the disenchanted Guinan is all the more important for us today, &ldquo;History's darkest moments can be a tipping point for change. There's still good here.&rdquo;</p>
								<p>Now, there is some debate about whether this young Guinan should have recognized Picard or not, and I've tried to explain it later in the &ldquo;Nerdery&rdquo; section, but let's not allow that to spoil our enjoyment of the episode... especially when the last two minutes of the show can do that for us! <span class="spoilerPlaceholder">(Additional spoiler content redacted)</span><span class="spoilerContent">First of all, Picard finally meets the Watcher: it appears to be Laris, but with rounded, human ears instead of her pointy, Vulcan ears. She utters only two words before she disappears with Picard, leaving the audience confused and wondering why Laris is here, in 2024, and why she appears human. Then we get to the final scene, where Q sits casually at a table performing a soliloquy at some woman that we've never met. Now the audience is even more confused because the scene comes completely out of the blue and we have <em>no</em> idea who that woman is. I don't mind leaving an episode on a cliffhanger, with anticipation, thinking &ldquo;What will happen next?&rdquo;... but I don't like leaving an episode in confusion, thinking &ldquo;What the hell just happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
								<span class="spoilerContent"><p>In my opinion, they should have saved the meeting between Picard and the Watcher until the next episode (instead of introducing it here as a confusing gimmick) and then inserted a scene earlier in the episode that introduces Renée Picard in some way. That way, we would at least know who Q is snapping his fingers at in the final scene, and it would still serve as a decent cliffhanger.</p></span>

								<p>There is a reason that young Guinan doesn't recognize Picard. Fans will remember that Guinan first met Picard in 1893 during the events of <a href="../tng/tng-s5.html#e26">TNG 5x26 &amp; 5x27: Time's Arrow</a>. But while Guinan was just living her normal life at that time, Picard had to travel back in time in order to meet her there. Because of Q's change to the timeline (even though the change hasn't happened yet) THIS Guinan’s future is one where the Federation doesn’t exist and is instead replaced with the Confederation. So, the events of Time's Arrow never happen, and Picard never goes back to 1893 to meet her. Now, that makes enough logical sense to me, and I highly recommend accepting the explanation and enjoying the episode as presented.</p>
								<p>Because, you see, if you want to start analyzing time paradoxes, you're probably just going to get a headache like Janeway does when she has to deal with time travel. In this case, it really just depends what you consider to have happened &ldquo;before&rdquo; or &ldquo;after&rdquo; other events. One might argue that since Q doesn't alter the timeline for another three days, this Guinan's future is still intact, and therefore she still should have met Picard in 1893. On the other hand, Picard came from a future that was already altered by Q, and by jumping back in time to before that alteration, he is still in the &ldquo;altered&rdquo; timeline... I mean, it's not all one thing, right? There's a reality where Q makes the change and a reality where Q doesn't make the change. In this reality where Q makes the change, Guinan doesn't meet Picard in 1893... he might not have made the change &ldquo;yet,&rdquo; but &ldquo;yet&rdquo; is relative. I wrote this second paragraph to be purposely confusing in order to make a point: time travel causes paradoxes that we can't easily explain. The thing is, whether Guinan recognizes Picard or doesn't recognize Picard &ndash; whether she met him in 1893 or didn't meet him in 1893 &ndash; both of these scenarios can both be proved and disproved logically. That's why it's called a paradox; now go enjoy the show!</p>

First, we're introduced to Tallinn, who is played by the same actress as Laris, but it's not Laris... and the explanation is thrown away as, &ldquo;I dunno, maybe Q did this as one of his little jokes.&rdquo; Then we see Dr. Adam Soong, played by Brent Spiner who famously played Data in <em>The Next Generation</em> and Altan Soong in Season One of <em>Picard</em>. This will be the fourth member of the Soong lineage played by Spiner &ndash; I guess the family had very strong genes. And finally, we meet Soong's daughter, Kore. She is played by Isa Briones, who played the android twins Dahj and Soji in Season One. No in-universe explanation is given for Kore's resemblance to the androids... at this point, I think they just gave up. This is another one of those episodes where it seems to just plod along a bit in order to get out the important story points that need to be set up for the following episode. The introduction of Adam Soong and Kore further confuses things in an already-complicated story.</p>

								<p>I love the idea for this episode &ndash; everyone in fancy clothes going to a swanky party sounds like a lot of fun, and it is! The interaction between Jurati and the Queen is enjoyable, and the juxtaposition of the forbidding Queen strolling around such and up-scale party is intriguingly disturbing. Poor Evan Evagora (Elnor), his character is dead but they keep calling him in just so that Raffi can keep hallucinating him. This time they made him put on an entire tuxedo for 1.5 seconds of footage and probably just sent him home after that.</p>
								<span class="spoilerContent">
								<p>Okay, let's talk about Queen Jurati's little performance. First of all, yes, she was lip syncing to a dubbed track, but the recording is that of actress <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Alison_Pill" target="_blank">Alison Pill</a>, herself. So she is lip syncing to her own voice simply for greater audio quality. The greater audio quality does make the performance feel a little bit fake during the quiet bits when it's clear that she couldn't have sounded that good without a microphone, but I am willing to forgive that. Also, it's not out of the realm of possibility that a good band with a solid repertoire could pick up on the song and provide appropriate accompaniment in the right key on the fly. And someone operating the spot light could have also picked up on what was happening and decided to play along. So, I can get on board with the performance. It's fun!</p>
								<p>What I <em>can't</em> get on board with is that the performance was a distraction that was needed because security was closing in on Picard, and it gave Rios enough time to brilliantly disguise Picard with the cunning use of… <em>a name tag with someone else's name on it</em>! Is this truly the stupidest security contingent ever to exist? Were they so transfixed by Jurati's performance that they all just forgot about Picard? Ugh.</p>

								<p>Okay, here we go...</p>
								
								<p>Since this is the lowest-rated episode of the series on IMDb, and I ended up giving it an above-average rating, I had to do some research into what people objected to, specifically, about the episode. I read a lot of the reviews and I found a number of trends. First, I had to sift through quite a few negative reviews that just said &ldquo;this isn't Star Trek&rdquo; without providing any specific explanation as to what they meant. This is a common line that people throw out about a lot of <em>Trek</em> since 2017, and often times it doesn't come with further explanation. There were also numerous reviews that cited &ldquo;bad writing&rdquo; without actually explaining what was &ldquo;bad&rdquo; about it.</p>
								
								<p>A few reviews called out one of the actors in this episode previously having been on Battlestar Galactica, but I don't think they were necessarily objecting to it. Several reviews called the episode &ldquo;filler,&rdquo; which I patently disagree with. It's true that it didn't focus on the larger series arc, but it was very much an intentional story that the storytellers wanted to impart this season. It provides important backstory to an already well-established character; it's not just a random adventure-of-the-week. And quite a few reviews found young-Guinan's weird performative summoning act toward the end to be ridiculous... now, that one I agree with, but I don't think it ruins the entire episode.</p>
								
								<p>The biggest trend I saw in the negative reviews was that viewers did not care about or did not understand Picard's childhood story, they objected to excessive &ldquo;psychobabble,&rdquo; and they disapproved of the show &ldquo;going the way of <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>&rdquo; in terms of its focus on introspection and personal journeys. I think this perspective is a real shame. I get that this episode was not a trek through the stars, but if anything, the perfect compliment to exploring the final frontier is the exploration of one's self, and that is exactly the kind of parallel this episode was trying to shine a spotlight on, via our hero, Picard.</p>
								
								<p>Of the reviewers that rated the episode favorably, they seemed to better understand and appreciate the meaning behind the story and the impact it has on Picard's life. This episode might seem more than little strange if this is your first time watching since you don't know the whole story yet. In fact, a lot of the elements are probably very confusing the first time through... but in the context of the entire season (particularly episode 9), this story makes a lot more sense. I'd recommend watching the rest of the series and then maybe coming back and watching this one again. This is certainly no &ldquo;filler&rdquo; story, it's a vital part of the man for whom this series is named: Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
								
								<p>Finally, on an entirely separate note, one reviewer was so confused by the Laris/Tallinn thing that they incorrectly thought that the Romulans were in charge of the Watchers. This is completely understandable, especially considering Tallinn's line, &ldquo;Usually, we're recruited to watch over our own, but on occasion, a similar species,&rdquo; which does make it sound like the Watchers are a uniquely Romulan phenomenon at first blush. On further consideration, she didn't necessarily say that the Romulans were the ones doing the recruiting, nor did she say that Romulans were the only species being recruited. It is confusing, to be sure, but there is a story thread in season 2 of <em>Star&nbsp;Trek:&nbsp;Prodigy</em> that removes some of the mystery surrounding the Watchers.</p>

Also, didn't Raffi complain earlier this season that they couldn't find anything in this alternate-universe la Sirena's medical bay? I guess they inventoried everything after Elnor died...?</li>

								<p>Now, if you've read my rant about how the previous episode was <em>not</em> filler, and you want to talk about what <em>is</em> filler, look no further than the A-plot of this episode. At least the previous episode was a backstory about someone we cared about. In this case, we get a backstory on someone we've never met! And to make matters worse, Agent Wells is played by <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Jay_Karnes" target="_blank">Jay Karnes</a>, who also memorably played Lieutenant Ducane, a protector of the timeline from the 29th century, in <a href="../voy/voy-s5.html#e24">VOY 5x24: Relativity</a>. When fans saw Karnes at the end of the previous episode, many probably thought this was Ducane in disguise. You know, there is time travel afoot already, so it would have been an interesting crossover to see Ducane investigating what has happened to the timeline, but... nope. Different character. Also, they try to do this cute little &ldquo;fate&rdquo; thing, saying that Wells had to have that childhood experience so he'd grow up to be the man who lets them go today, but he was the one who incarcerated them in the first place, so...</p>
								
								<p>Of course, there are other, more important plot lines in this episode. We have Queen Jurati kicking ass in a red dress and combat boots, Guinan meeting Q for the first time, a tender moment between Rios and Teresa, and, well the whole Soong and Kore thing. We also learn that Raffi feels a deep guilt because she's the reason that Elnor was at the academy, and now she feels responsible for his death. Gosh, that probably would have been more impactful for the audience to have learned way back in episode 3. </p>

								<p>If you weren't interested in the young Picard's story line from two episodes ago, I'm afraid you might not be a fan of this episode, either. This time, they try to soften the blow of all that annoying introspection by interspersing it with action and guns from the small Borg army outside. I am being facetious, of course. Personally, I prefer the thoughtful story line to the mindless fighting, but to each their own! 
								
								<p><span class="spoilerContent">
								Complaints about this episode include the belief that it doesn't follow canon, because viewers thought that Picard's mother lived to old age. Well, if you pay attention to the dialog toward the end of this episode, that is explained. People also threw in the absence of Picard's brother as evidence of failing to follow previously-established canon, but again, if you pay attention to the dialog in the first episode of this season, it's explained that his brother is away at school. If you don't want to like this season or the entire series, that is your business, but you can't hold things against it that just aren't true.</p>
								
								<p>Well, besides those two main story lines, we have the ongoing battle between Jurati and the Queen and, I have to say, it comes to an insanely stupid conclusion here. Jurati somehow convinces the Borg Queen &ndash; an entity synonymous with terror and evil &ndash; to assimilate for good instead of bad? What the actual hell. You know, not everyone needs salvation in a story; it's okay to keep some of your &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; as bad guys.

							The gang must stop Soong, saving Renée and the Europa mission. They succeed in a combined effort, but Tallinn sacrifices herself to get the job done. A defeated Soong decides to look into something called “Project Khan,” and his estranged daughter Kore is recruited into the Travelers by Wesley Crusher. Picard forgives himself for his past, placing the skeleton key back in its hiding place in the wall for his future, younger self to find. Q shows up, congratulating him on the decision, and explaining that he wanted to give Picard the gift of forgiveness. In his final act, Q uses his last bit of power to return the gang (sans Rios) back to their time, but not before a heartfelt embrace with Picard. Back in Episode 1 with the Borg Queen assimilating all the ships, she lowers her mask to reveal that it’s Dr. Jurati. There’s a Big Nasty Space MacGuffin (BNSM) about to blow up the quadrant, so they work together to make a Big Nasty Space MacGuffin Shield (BNSMS) to stop it. With that business taken care of, Picard wraps things up with the gang, with Guinan, and finally with Laris.

		<div class="seasonName">Season 2 Review<br><span style="font-size:small;font-family:sans-serif;color:#E0C0A0"><span style="text-shadow: red 0px 0px 12px">🚨</span> Definitely contains spoilers <span style="text-shadow: red 0px 0px 12px">🚨</span></span></div>
		<p>The storytelling this season is more linear and less jumbled than last season, even with all the time travel shenanigans. Let's talk about each major element of this season separately, in an order of my choosing. Most of this season takes place in 2024, where we get our interaction between Rios and Teresa, which I rather enjoyed. I thought they worked well together, and their progress effectively led up to the not-too-surprising decision Rios made to stay behind. Their story did well in remaining in the background and not pulling too much focus from the main story lines; it never felt out of place or overdone. On the hand, the ICE raid, detention, and escape weren't really as important to the story, but it served mostly to provide some conflict and action manifested as a car chase, which was enjoyable.</p>
		
		<p>We also have, of course, the Dr. Jurati versus Borg Queen story. Overall, I think it worked very well. Alison Pill (Jurati) and Annee Wersching (Borg Queen) did a great job portraying their characters and working off of each other's performance. It is somewhat fitting that this happened to Jurati, since she has spent most of her adult life working in the cybernetics field. I wish they had played more into that aspect of her life as an explanation for how and why she interacted the way she did with the Queen, especially toward the end when they more-fully &ldquo;merge.&rdquo; As it stands, the relationship falls apart for me when Jurati posits that the Borg Queen has just been &ldquo;lonely&rdquo; all this time, and somehow convinces her to stop being evil and instead spread joy and rainbows across the galaxy. I think the writers <em>tried</em> to make it make sense, but it didn't really come through.</p>
		
		<p>The Raffi/Seven (and lack of Elnor) adventure was just okay, I think. Clearly they both have some things to work through, but I actually don't think they spent <em>enough</em> time on their story to do it justice. First of all, Raffi's reaction to Elnor's death isn't fully explained until five episodes later, and then she just trauma-dumps to a <em>hologram</em> of Elnor, which probably isn't too healthy, psychologically speaking. Seven is clearly enjoying her time being free of her Borg implants, which is a great avenue to explore! But then she gets annoyed with Raffi in episode 8 for reasons I can't decipher. It's clear the two have a history, but we weren't privy to it, so it's hard to determine what exactly is going on between them. Still, it's all okay, I think it just needed a little <em>more</em>.</p>
		
		<p>Agent Wells was unnecessary. Did they just need another delay from our heroes making progress? His little childhood story was okay, but it just didn't add anything to the season. If they wanted something else to block out more time, I think there could have been a better story here with deeper ties into the <em>Trek</em> lore.</p>
		
		<p>Young Guinan was fun, I enjoyed her, and I think actress Ito Aghayere did a fine job stepping into the role. If anything, at least the Agent Wells story let us see more of her. There were two points I didn't particularly like, though. One was the silly &ldquo;summoning&rdquo; ritual, and the other was her appearing to Picard as an apparition while they were in Agent Wells' custody. Guinan and her species, the El-Aurians, were never previously depicted as having &ldquo;powers&rdquo; of any kind like that. Their main characteristics are that they're &ldquo;listeners,&rdquo; that they are sensitive to changes in the timeline, and that they live very long lives. This always gave them a sense of subtle mystery, so I'm not a fan of them suddenly having overt superpowers.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, four more topics to go. Next we have the Tallinn/Renée storyline. This was integral to the overall story, since Renée is the focal point of the change that Q makes in the timeline. I liked the story for the most part, and having Tallinn be able to really meet Renée at the end was a nice touch, but it might have had a little more impact if we had felt Tallinn's connection to Renée a little more deeply. Perhaps some flashback scenes showing Tallinn watching over Renée at various times in the past, watching her grow up over the years, rather than just having Tallinn tell us about it. It's also a bit of a stretch that this one small change in the timeline would cause the future to turn entirely upside-down and be purely evil, but I suppose that is part of the running theme about the butterfly effect, so I'll allow it.</p>
		
		<p>Adam Soong and Kore. Listen, I want Brent Spiner and Isa Briones to be involved as much as anyone, but I've already said my piece about them playing completely different characters. Spiner playing another Soong is almost forgivable, but Briones playing an entirely different character is just distracting. Furthermore, Kore only serves as Soong's motivation to side with Q against Picard, so I found myself sort of not caring about when she liberated herself and made a big fuss about it. Then she came back just to delete all of Soong's work out of spite and then &ndash; completely out of the blue &ndash; she randomly gets whisked away by Wesley Crusher?? What the actual hell? Back to Soong, he starts off as a sort of &ldquo;mad scientist&rdquo; but later turns into the owner of a small Borg army, because why not. Then after all of his efforts fail, he has to pull out one more gimmicky plan: the totally unnecessary Khan reference. It was just too much.</p>
		
		<p>For a moment, let's imagine if Soong and Kore were entirely absent from this season. What would happen? Well, first of all, Q wouldn't have been able to recruit him to help thwart Picard. Instead of Soong trying to sic security on Picard and then running him over with a car, the antagonist at the swanky ball could have been Q, himself! I suspect it might have been even more fun to have the gang contending with some of Q's shenanigans at the ball instead of Soong. Next, Borg Queen Jurati wouldn't have been able to use Soong's resources to amass a small Borg army. Well, that is fixed easily enough by writing literally any other reason that she's able to find enough people to round up and assimilate into an army. I don't think they need to be &ldquo;ex-special forces&rdquo;, it could have just been anyone whose abilities she enhanced through assimilation. Then, without Soong around to attempt to poison Renée before the Europa mission launch... oh, well, he was acting with his own motivations at that point, so I guess Tallinn wouldn't have had to die! I don't know, I suppose that part of the story would have changed, but we could have just come up with a different bad guy, maybe? Finally, if Soong and Kore weren't part of this story, there would be no one to get recruited by Wesley Crusher and no one to ominously pull out a folder marked &ldquo;Project Khan&rdquo; for no reason... and since neither of those things matter, that's no big loss. So, it seems to me that Soong and Kore's stories aren't really crucial to the overall story, and they <em>do</em> feel out of place here because they aren't well-linked to the rest.</p>
		
		<p>And that brings us to the story about Picard's childhood. The boy, the key, and the solarium. It's the story that seems to be polarizing &ndash; fans either love it or hate it, with not much in between. But if one can expand their definition of <em>Star Trek</em> beyond flying around in spaceships, one can come to appreciate the journey within being the perfect compliment to the exploration of outer space. This story adds a wonderful new dimension to a very well-established and beloved character, and it colors Picard's motivations for all of his previous adventures. It gives us a whole new way to look at his actions throughout <em>The Next Generation</em>.</p>
		
		<p>So that just leaves us with the bookends to this story. Specifically, the masked Borg Queen taking over the Starfleet ships. Well, it was certainly an effective way to open the season with some action and mystery. But when we come back in the last episode as events progressed, I sort of just went, &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; First we have the Jurati reveal, and it just felt like something wasn't right about it. I guess it was on purpose that they had the juxtaposition of the forbidding, evil-seeming black cloaked figure against the kind, warm face of Jurati... but it didn't quite work for me. Then there's the galaxy-ending event that is just way out of the blue and never really explained. I <em>think</em> that it may have just been a way to set up a new <em>thing</em> for a potential new show down the line. <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> takes place between 2399 and 2402, and after that, there really isn't any more canon story until Burnham shows up in 3188. Since Kirk's story was in the 2200s and Picard's story was in the 2300s, it would make sense to consider starting another <em>Trek</em> era just after the events of this show, in the 2400s. But as it stands, we just have a Big Nasty Space MacGuffin that is never explained.</p>
		
		<p>So, after all that, how do I rate this season compared to the others? I think it was markedly better than Season 1, and though I enjoy Season 3, I have some objections to it, as well. On my first watch-through of this series, Season 2 was my favorite, and I very much want to give it the controversial First Place position. But on the whole, after a second watch-through, I must give the coveted First Place ribbon to Season 3, meaning that Season 2 gets Second Place.</p>
