		Currently, updates on this site are primarily focused on <span style="text-decoration:underline">content</span>, with a secondary focus on features and accessibility for <span style="text-decoration:underline">desktop browsers</span>. I am aware that this site doesn't really look good on smaller screens, such as tablets or phones. Some day, maybe after most of the content is done, maybe then I'll work on making the site more mobile-friendly. Until then... enjoy these content updates!

					Minor improvements to the <em>Prodigy</em> series timeline; added two notes in the <em>DS9</em> episodes guides where important events from <em>Voyager</em> overlap; disabled ligatures in searchable episode tables and the main timeline search; added text-to-speech to the About page; improved the look of the TNG-style combadge icon so it doesn't appear quite as flat; tweaked GA code to avoid localhost reporting; and I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but I found more hyphen-work to do, because I couldn't get enough of it last May... this time it involved switching to non-breaking hyphens in all ship registry numbers and/or letter suffixes. Hooray!

					<li>Recognizing that I am biased toward <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, I demoted 11 episodes of that series from a &ldquo;Must Watch&rdquo; recommendation, in order to make the Must Watch list a little more consumable and to bring the series closer in line with the other shows of its era.
