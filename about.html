	<p>C6 is just another of many internet denizens who posts his opinions about Star Trek stuff. His opinion is no more important than anyone else's, it's just that he took the time to make this idiotic website. He celebrates our differences and is happy if you like an episode he doesn't like, or if you hate an episode he loves - he really just wants this site to be a helpful resource for people who might be new to the Trek universe.</p>
	<p>C6 grew up in the 90s with great Trek like <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, and <em>Voyager</em>, and he's excited that Trek has made a return to television... er, a streaming service. C6 has spent much of his life trying to temper his enthusiasm for Star Trek and not be too &quot;nerdy&quot; about it, but he's starting to embrace his inner Trekkie as he gets older. C6 is NOT a Star Trek &quot;purist&quot; and he doesn't have any hard and fast rules about what Trek &quot;should&quot; or &quot;shouldn't&quot; be. He thinks it's important to allow yourself to enjoy each new iteration of Star Trek in its own light, and not get hung up on comparing it to things that came before.</p>
