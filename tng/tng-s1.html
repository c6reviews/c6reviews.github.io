	<div class="seasonSummary">
		<div class="seasonName">Season 1</div>
		<p>I'm going to put it out there up front: Seasons 1 and 2 aren't great. But we're going to power through them together, okay? I promise that things get better in Season 3.</p>
		<p>The sets are minimal, the costumes are silly, the lighting is harsh (to the point that you will notice matte-black patches placed on the bridge's rear computer terminals in an attempt to block reflected light), the sound picks up too much ambient noise (echoes, footsteps, even the set floors shifting under the weight of the actors), and the actors are only just beginning to get into their roles. Not only that, but the stories range from &ldquo;just average&rdquo; to &ldquo;unintentionally idiotic&rdquo; to &ldquo;downright racist&rdquo;. As <a href="https://sfdebris.com" target="_blank">SFDebris</a> once described it (in his review of &ldquo;Angel One&rdquo;), many of these episodes are &ldquo;<em>TOS</em>-style stories, 20 years too late&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>Most of these issues are fixed in Season 3, but it's from these... er... <span style="font-style:normal">humble</span> beginnings that the famed crew of the Enterprise&#8209;D will forge their bonds. The season opens with a premiere which introduces Q to us for the first time and then immediately after that, the crew gets drunk! Other than that, we'll get some backstories for our new characters and also experience some classic holodeck malfunctions.</p>
		<p>I will also use this space to point out that many of the Enterprise&#8209;D sets were reuses of sets from the original Refit Enterprise in <em>Star Trek</em> films 1-3. Some were effectively redressed enough to be distinct, but other sets were very obvious reuses &ndash; and that sort of makes you wonder why Starfleet ship technology didn't seem to change in the 80+ years that intervened between the movies and <em>The Next Generation</em>. On top of that, some of the new <em>TNG</em> sets were then used for films 5 and 6! I could go into more detail, but I don't have to because Ex&nbsp;Astris&nbsp;Scientia has an extensive analysis on the subject that can be found here: <a href="https://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/inconsistencies/reused_ship_interiors.htm" target="_blank">Re-Used Starship Interiors</a>.</p>

							<strong>Thoughts: </strong>
							Well, here we are, all the way back to 1987 when <em>TNG</em> made its debut, with the first of several stories involving an ideal word with a terrible secret. The idea and story are actually pretty decent, but the show definitely had a long way to go before they'd get into their &ldquo;groove&rdquo;. We are introduced to the mysterious entity who calls himself &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, and who will become an important (though infrequent) character for the series. It's fascinating to know that the Q story in this episode was only added after they were granted a full 1.5-hour, feature-length pilot. Originally, the story was only about Farpoint station. Can you imagine how... well, less iconic this series premiere would have been without Q?
							
							<p>As for the crew, Yar is notably more... aggressive and careless than I remember, and in such a way that seems like she's not actually very suited for the professionalism required by her job. This is the only time we'll see Troi in a real Starfleet uniform until halfway through Season 6, because someone working on the show quickly decided that we needed more cleavage and less professionalism on the bridge. However, this early episode does make Troi seem like she's actually more involved in bridge operations. This will quickly die off. We'll also see Miles O'Brien for the first time here, even though he doesn't even have a name yet!</p>
							
							<p>The episode finds excuses to show what the new ship can do: it goes fast, and it breaks in two. Picard orders Riker to perform a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; docking of the ship's stardrive section with the saucer section. Typical middle management: stand next to a chair doing nothing, shout out a few orders for other people to do the actual work, and then take all the credit for that &ldquo;manual&rdquo; docking. Anyway, the concept for the Enterprise&#8209;D sure is a strange one. It's basically a giant space resort, housing officers and families alike, with stores and salons and schools and restaurants and bars... even the bridge is designed to feel like a comfy living room. This concept comes from an idealized view of the future of space travel, but it is difficult to reconcile the idea with the fact that the flagship of the Federation is often sent into dangerous situations. This is partly why the ship separation feature was introduced: in dangerous situations, the saucer section can carry the civilians to safety while the stardrive section handles the trouble. The problem is, breaking the ship in two every time there's a crisis is impractical from a storytelling perspective, so including this episode, we only see the ship performing this function a grand total of FOUR times (only three times in this series, and once in a movie).</p>
							
							<p>The episode also gives us a glimpse at the new holodeck technology, and a visit by Leonard McCoy at an in-universe age of 137. DeForest Kelley was 67 at the time so, yes, they gave him a heavy coat of makeup to make him appear much more elderly. Finally, we also meet Wesley Crusher, who makes an incursion onto the bridge in this episode, and then takes over the entire ship in the next episode. I think these first two episodes are what expedited Wesley's garnering of annoyance and dislike by audiences.</p>
							
							<p>Compared to the rest of the season, this pilot is actually pretty good. I'm giving it an extra half-star for its efforts to set the series off on a good start. Unfortunately, after this episode, we immediately fall into less-inspired stories until sometime in Season 3.</p>

							<p>But the real stupidity in this episode is, of course, the Ferengi. Believe it or not, the Ferengi were supposed to be the primary adversary for this show... but for some reason, they were directed to be a ridiculous farce of a civilized species. And so, the Ferengi went on to be used more for comedy relief than as a serious foe. I mean, just watching them bounce around like idiots while Riker speaks to Portal... it's truly painful to watch.</p>

The great &ldquo;moral&rdquo; question here is whether the Enterprise crew should respect and obey this society's laws and punishments, even if they find them to be, shall we say, cruel and unusual? They make it a point that the Prime Directive tells them they must obey others' laws but... well, there's just so much wrong here and it's not nearly that cut and dry. First of all, according to the Prime Directive, the Enterprise shouldn't have made contact with this pre-warp civilization at all. Second, Yar's report on this society's laws most certainly should have included enforcement and punishment procedures. But it seems everyone was just far too eager to beam down to the planet where everyone is naked and constantly having sex. The idea that this episode tries to tackle such a <em>mature</em> concept as the Prime Directive and respect for law and order against a backdrop of such an <em>immature</em> concept of &ldquo;Everyone on this planet is hot and horny!&rdquo; is truly groan-inducing.</div></td>

In this case, Wesley is essentially single-handedly responsible for saving the ship and doesn't get so much as a &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Sorry for telling you to shut up earlier&rdquo;.

A joke, a smile, and/or some sort of affirmation of the nobility of Starfleet and humanity? This was the hallmark of early <em>Trek</em>: no matter what horrible tragedy might have been suffered during the episode, everything is just right as rain before the credits roll. It's certainly different than a lot of modern television, but it's kind of nice knowing that you can watch a story and always come away from it feeling good.</p>
							
							<p>There's a message in this episode about becoming too reliant on technology without actually understanding how it works. While I don't think humanity is doomed to repeat the mistakes of the Aldeans, there is an interesting parallel with present-day computer literacy. We have seen computer literacy increase with the Millennial generation, since they essentially grew up at the same time that personal computing was &ldquo;growing up&rdquo;. They learned how to use, troubleshoot, and fix computers out of necessity. Now we see that younger generations have actually <em>decreased</em> in computer literacy because computing technology has improved to a point where often times, it just &ldquo;works&rdquo; and there's no need to understand the inner-workings. Just something to think about.</p>

At the end of the episode, Wesley says he &ldquo;failed&rdquo;, and Picard admits to having &ldquo;failed&rdquo; the test his first time. But it's not a pass/fail test; it's not as if they failed to reach some sort of cut-off score... no, they were pitted against three other candidates, and only the highest-scoring was allowed to proceed. That doesn't mean the other three <em>failed</em>.<br><br>
								
								Also, the whole story about Quinn and Remmick's audit of the Enterprise leads up to Quinn telling Picard that he suspects a serious threat to the Federation, and that he needs people he can trust. So he wants to make Picard Commandant to the Academy? That doesn't seem like a very crucial position, but I suppose we can explain it away as Quinn trying to be subtle about surrounding himself with trusted officers. But then Picard turns down the position and Quinn is just like &ldquo;Eh, it's probably nothing, anyway.&rdquo;</div>

							<td><div class="thoughtsSection"><strong>Thoughts: </strong>Ugghhhh. Between Clemond's ridiculous idioms and Offenhouse's superiority complex, these are easily the most annoying characters I've had the displeasure of watching on this show so far. Bring back the Ferengi; I'd rather watch them, because these two men are insufferable. This episode is a lie. It may be called &ldquo;The Neutral Zone&rdquo;, but there is <em>barely</em> twelve minutes devoted to that story. Assume about 3 minutes for opening and closing credits, and that leaves us with <em>30 excruciating minutes about these three thoroughly annoying relics</em>. Furthermore, the episode foists upon us Gene Roddenberry's naïve take on the future: that 24th-century humans have become so enlightened that they don't need to take simple security measures to lock out a communications panel or to restrict access to the bridge because, well, <em>WHY WOULD ANYONE EVER DO THOSE THINGS IF THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO?</em> It's not as if the whole mission of the ship is to seek out new life and new civilizations, perhaps new life and civilizations that aren't as <em>enlightened</em> as humans, so maybe basic security measures aren't such an unnecessary bother. Finally, when Ralph somehow makes it to the bridge to demand to speak to the manager, Picard orders security to remove him... but Ralph protests and the security officers just stand there impotently like there's nothing they can do about it. Ugh, this episode is exhausting.</div></td>
