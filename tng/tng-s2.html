	<div class="seasonSummary">
		<div class="seasonName">Season 2</div>
		<p>We can do this! We're over half-way through the episodes in Seasons 1 and 2!</p>
		
		<p>In <em>TNG</em>'s second season, we have some updates and changes. Geordi La Forge has been promoted to Lieutenant. He is now the Chief Engineer and wears a gold uniform. Worf has been made the new security chief, and he also has switched to a gold uniform. A few episodes into the season, Miles O'Brien will finally be referred to by name for the first time. Now, his rank insignia is going to be all over the place, so we're just going to ignore it, okay? Canonically, he is an enlisted man.</p>
		
		<p>We also have a new shrew of a Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Katherine Pulaski. The reason behind this is because of some unpleasant business between showrunner Maurice Hurley and actor Gates McFadden (Dr. Crusher), but don't worry, Hurley will be replaced in Season 3, and Gates will be brought back to play Dr. Crusher for the rest of the series.</p>
		
		<p>The Ten Forward set is new, and it brings with it a mysterious new bartender named Guinan. She'll make appearances in a total of 28 episodes of <em>TNG</em>, 2 movies, and 5 more episodes of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>. There's also some set updates on the bridge, including a new captain's chair and replacement of the brown wall panels. Most importantly, of course, is that Riker has grown a beard and will keep it for the remainder of the series.</p>
		
		<p>This season has some memorable and important episodes in it, like &ldquo;The Measure of a Man&rdquo; and &ldquo;Q Who&rdquo;. I'd dare to say that it's a slight improvement over Season 1, but there are still some real stinkers in here. I have marked five episodes in this entire series as &ldquo;Notably Bad&rdquo;, and three of them are in Season 2.</p>

[Oops, correction: I forgot that Riker was sexually assaulted in <a href="tng-s4.html#e23">TNG 4x23: The Host</a>, but they don't treat it like an assault. Nah, that's just awesome sex-having, am I right? (reaches out for a high-five)]

Considering the marvelous complexity of our universe, its clockwork perfection, its balances of this against that, matter, energy, gravitation, time, dimension, I believe that our existence must be more than either of these philosophies.

Do you throw the switch? This is supposed to spark philosophical discussion about the value of a life and the implications of deciding who dies versus non-interference. Here, Picard decides to run over the five people, back up, throw the switch, and also run over the sixth person... just so the evil person who tied all the people to these tracks won't get the satisfaction of running his experiment. I understand that the idea is to go out quickly on their own terms versus allowing cruel and painful experiments to be performed via lottery &ndash; I suppose that is worth some discussion of its own &ndash; but there is no attempt at diplomacy or negotiation, and no attempt at resistance or to fight back. They just... give up. I really don't think this has quite the philosophical impact the writers thought it did.

It's frequently stated that holographic matter cannot exist outside of the holodeck, but it was also established early in this series that some of the material created on the holodeck is replicated, &ldquo;real&rdquo; matter. Indeed, we've seen Wesley come out of the holodeck dripping wet with holographic water, and he once threw a snowball through the doors, hitting Picard in the hallway. Even in this very episode, Moriarty makes a drawing on holographic paper which Data takes with him out of the holodeck and to the conference room.

							<td><div class="thoughtsSection expandable" style="max-height:70px"><p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>This is certainly an iconic episode of <em>TNG</em>, often highly-rated and often discussed and touted as one of the series' best episodes. And here I am, writing a long opinion about what's wrong with it... but there's just so much lunacy around the procedures and the very premise of this legal battle.</p>
							
							<p>First, let's acknowledge that I am not a lawyer, but let us also acknowledge that this episode does not provide us with enough information to truly analyze the legal merits of the fictional &ldquo;Acts of Cumberland&rdquo; on which Louvois based her original ruling. Nor do we have access to any other case law or precedent that may have been established in this fictional universe. We have only what is presented to us in the episode, which is obviously not enough for anyone to evaluate the in-universe validity of any of the arguments made here, on either side.</p>
							
							<p>But I'm still going to try. Louvois rules that 1) Data is the property of Starfleet, 2) Data cannot resign, and 3) Data cannot refuse to cooperate with Maddox. This is wrought with problems. First, assertions 1 and 2 are absolutely incompatible. If Data is the property of Starfleet, then the second assertion must be &ldquo;Data should not have been given a Starfleet commission in the first place&rdquo;, not that he &ldquo;can't resign&rdquo;. One could argue that Starfleet has already decided on the matter of whether Data is property: No, because Starfleet property is not permitted to attend the academy and earn a commission. Either Data has the right to resign just as any other commissioned officer does, or Starfleet was wrong to give him a commission in the first place.</p>
							
							<p>Further, on what legal basis does Starfleet claim ownership of Data? The &ldquo;Finders Keepers&rdquo; Act of 2252? This is where we get into a bit of a grey area since, again, we don't have 24th-century law books to study. But if the Federation's laws are anything like today's laws, then if Data is anyone's property, he would be the property of his creator, Noonien Soong. It's unclear what Soong's status is at this point, but even if he is presumed dead, then Data would be the property of Soong's estate. There is no indication that Soong would have bequeathed Data to Starfleet &ndash; in fact, in a later episode, we find that Soong was actually a bit disappointed about Data <em>choosing</em> to join Starfleet. So, again, I really have to wonder what Starfleet's claim of ownership is based on. It certainly can't be that &ldquo;Data chose to join Starfleet, therefore Starfleet owns Data&rdquo; because those two statements are antithetical!</p>
							
							<p>So let's get to the procedural aspect. Picard objects to Louvois' ruling, so she is forced to hold a hearing, but she is understaffed. Lucky for us, there is a completely asinine procedure for just such an event! Picard gets to serve as the defense because he is the ship's captain, not because he's the one who issued the challenge. And Riker is forced into &ldquo;prosecuting&rdquo; the case just because he's the next most senior officer, even though he firmly sides with the captain's (and Data's) position. *sigh* Okay, first of all, there is no &ldquo;prosecution&rdquo; here because this is not a <em>criminal case</em>. Second, and most obviously, if you're understaffed and don't have legal experts to serve as counsel, you don't just force military officers into the roles for the sake of procedure. Riker representing Maddox is insane &ndash; Riker is no more a legal expert than Maddox, so why doesn't Maddox just represent himself? He'd be better off, since Riker doesn't believe in his cause, anyway. None of this makes any sense.</p>
							
							<p>But we will plod on. Riker has Data bend a thick metal rod. Picard rightfully objects on the basis that Data's strength has nothing to do with anything, but he's overruled by Louvois who inspects the bent rod as if it is crucial evidence. Next, Riker wants to remove Data's arm. The captain again objects, but then withdrawals the objection before even articulating it. Seriously though, is there some case law that says, &ldquo;If it can bend a metal rod, it's property. If you can remove its arm, it's property&rdquo;? None of this has anything to do with the issue at hand.</p>
							
							<div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/tng-2x09-bent.png" style="width:400px" alt="Louvois inspecting the bent rod with a speech balloon, saying 'I have many years of study and experience in law, and I can confirm that this rod is, indeed, bent. Obviously this means that Data is property. I don't see how Picard could possibly win this argument.'"></div>
							
							<p>Thankfully, Picard gets this hearing back on the rails. He concedes that Data is a machine that was created by a human, and rightfully reminds everyone in the room that those facts have no bearing on these proceedings. It's Picard's talk with Guinan along with his impassioned speech to the court that provide a meaningful emotional component to the episode and help to make up for any of its previous shortcomings.</p>

Remind me to decline any future brunch invitations with the senior staff. Anyway, there are so many unanswered questions in this episode. Why was the shuttle thrown back in time? Why was everything reversed (the shuttle's power requirements and future-Picard's reaction to stimulants and sedatives)? Why did flying through the vortex allow them to escape?

		<p>The film <a href="../films/v-tff.html"><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em></a> was released on June 9, 1989. The movie has long been considered a terrible addition to the <em>Trek</em> franchise.
