			<p>Season 1 of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> tells the story of a retired Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, about 20 years after we last saw him in <a href="../films/nemesis.html"><em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em></a>. He meets a young android woman who is a sort of daughter to his late friend, Data. Picard embarks on a quest to find her creator, a cyberneticist named Bruce Maddox, and to uncover why a shadowy sect of the Romulan secret police are hellbent on her destruction.</p>

							Picard sits down for a news interview on the twelfth anniversary of the Romulan star going supernova. He recounts the story of the rogue synthetics that decimated the rescue fleet on Mars which led to a ban on synths, and then bitterly leaves the interview when he's forced to explain that he left Starfleet after they withdrew from the Romulan rescue effort. Meanwhile, a young woman named Dahj is attacked one evening by three men in black helmets. Something &ldquo;clicks&rdquo; and she is suddenly able to kick their butts, and then she begins to have visions of Picard. She seeks him out for help and finds him at his château vineyard.<span class="spoilerContent"> After some investigation, Picard determines that she is an android, and a sort of daughter of Data's. Sadly, Dahj is again attacked by the black helmets and doesn't make it out alive. Determined to get to the bottom of this, Picard seeks out a cyberneticist at Daystrom Institute by the name of Agnes Jurati. She tells Picard that androids of this type are made in pairs. In the last scene, we see that Dahj's twin, Soji, is working with the Romulans at a reclamation site on a Borg cube.</span>

								<p>After 17 years, Patrick Stewart finally reprises his role of Jean-Luc Picard, and I was more than a little excited. How do I possibly rate these episodes at all, let alone individually? Each season is a 10-episode story, so do I rate each episode on its own merit, or within the context of the overall story? Am I even capable of giving a 1-star rating to any of these when I'm just so happy to see Jean-Luc again?</p>
								
								<p>There's a good bit to take in for this very first episode. We start with the poker scene in Ten Forward to get all the fanboys squealing right off the bat (myself included). Then Picard has to get some exposition out there by way of a news interview so that we can establish the backdrop of past events. As exposition vehicles go, this interview was a pretty good way to go, I think. Then we have Dahj, a seemingly happy-go-lucky young woman who suddenly turns into an elite fighting machine for the requisite action scenes so that people don't start wandering away out of boredom. I'm fine with that; of course there has to be some action. I'm just glad they didn't double-down and throw in a gratuitous sex scene to garner additional viewership. We get lots of fan service by way of the archive room and all its easter eggs, and then another action scene<span class="spoilerContent"> that unexpectedly kills off what we thought was a main character</span>. Picard goes off to Okinawa so Dr. Agnes Jurati can exposit about androids,<span class="spoilerContent"> with an unintentionally-hilarious cameo by B-4's head,</span> and finally we get the money shot at the end<span class="spoilerContent"> of the Borg cube</span> which made everyone say, &ldquo;Wait, whaaaat?&rdquo; so of course they will tune in to the second episode.</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p>I wish they had handled the explanation of Dahj's existence as Data's &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; a little better. Rather than this weird theory that Data's &ldquo;essence&rdquo; could be reconstituted from a single positronic neuron (or whatever) and just having B-4 in a drawer like discarded trash, they really could have used B-4 as the link between Data and Dahj. We got that glimmer of hope at the end of <em>Nemesis</em> that B-4 really did contain Data's &ldquo;essence&rdquo; and that glimmer was left unexplored. What if Maddox had somehow harvested that essence in order to create Dahj and Soji, rather than just leaving it to &ldquo;I dunno, he did it somehow&rdquo;?</p>
								
								<p>After having re-watched the entire season again, it turns out that Dahj and Soji's existence <em>was</em> directly related to Data's memory download into B-4. This is just one of many points in this season that doesn't get enough focus or proper explanation because of all the different elements that get thrown at the viewer during its jumbled storytelling.</p>

								<li>The song &ldquo;Blue Skies&rdquo; which opens this series is a reference to Data, who sings the song at Will and Deanna's wedding in <a href="../films/nemesis.html"><em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em></a>.</li>
								<li>Picard's dog is named &ldquo;Number One.&rdquo; This is the nickname he gave his first officer, Commander William Riker, on the Enterprise&#8209;D.</li>
								<li>Dahj's boyfriend is Xahean. The only other member of this race we've seen is Me Hani Ika Hali Ka Po from the Short Treks episode <a href="../dis/sho-s1.html#e01">SHO 1x01: Runaway</a>.</li>
								<li>Picard orders &ldquo;tea, Earl Grey, decaf.&rdquo; This references Picard's frequent order on the Enterprise for &ldquo;tea, Earl Grey, hot.&rdquo;</li>
								<li>The Romulan sun going supernova is a central plot point for this season. It occurred 12 years prior, and it was the event responsible for throwing Spock and Nero back in time and altering the timeline, as told in the film <a href="../films/startrek2009.html"><em>Star Trek</em> [2009]</a>.</li>
								<li>The person interviewing Picard brings up the destruction of the Utopia Planitia Shipyard by synthetic lifeforms on Mars. This event occurred 2 years before the supernova, and that story is told in the next episode, <a href="#e02">PIC 1x02 Maps and Legends</a>. There is also a short story about some of the victims of the attack in the Short Treks episode <a href="../dis/sho-s2.html#e06">SHO 2x06: Children of Mars</a>, and there's more about Starfleet's reaction to the attack in the <em>Prodigy</em> series finale, <a href="../pro/pro-s2.html#e20">PRO 2x20: Ouroboros, Part II</a>.</li>
								<li>Picard's Archive is replete with items from his past.<br><br>
									<ul>
										<li>As he enters, in the foreground is a model of the USS Stargazer NCC-2893, Picard's first command. This model was prominently displayed in his Ready Room onboard the Enterprise&#8209;D.</li>
										<li>Hanging from the ceiling is the &ldquo;Captain Picard Day&rdquo; banner that was presented to him by the children of the Enterprise&#8209;D in <a href="../tng/tng-s7.html#e12">TNG 7x12: The Pegasus</a>.</li>
										<li>On a pedestal in the back, a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kurlan_naiskos" target="_blank">Kurlan naiskos</a> is seen, presumably the one he obtained in <a href="../tng/tng-s6.html#e20">TNG 6x20: The Chase</a> (even though Picard is seen putting it aside and leaving it behind in <a href="../films/generations.html"><em>Star Trek: Generations</em></a>).</li>
										<li>Other items include: A model of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-E, a model of the Captain's Yacht from the Enterprise-E, a dorsal-view picture of the Enterprise&#8209;D, a Klingon <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bat'leth" target="_blank">bat'leth</a> sword, a Klingon <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/D%27k_tahg" target="_blank">d'k tahg</a> dagger, and several books, plaques, and certificates.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Picard tells Dahj that Data sacrificed himself for him on their last mission together, and Jurati tells Picard that Data tried to download his consciousness into an inferior copy called B-4. These are both plot points from the film <a href="../films/nemesis.html"><em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em></a>.</li>
								<li>Jurati also talks about a cyberneticist named Bruce Maddox who recruited her out of Starfleet. Bruce appears in <a href="../tng/tng-s2.html#e09">TNG 2x09: The Measure of a Man</a> where he tries to order Data to his lab for further study and, after some legal proceedings, it is determined that Data had the right to refuse him.</li>

							After a flashback featuring the rogue synth attack on Mars 14 years prior, Picard and Laris investigate Dahj's death. Laris suspects the &ldquo;Zhat Vash,&rdquo; a Romulan cabal even more enigmatic than the Tal Shiar, the Romulan secret police. They determine that Dahj's twin sister is not on Earth, so Picard makes preparations to go off-world, including a medical clearance and a request to the Starfleet CinC to be reinstated. Meanwhile, Soji befriends a new recruit and has become intimate with Narek as she begins her work on the Borg artifact: disassembling Borg drones.<span class="spoilerContent"> When Picard's request for reinstatement is summarily dismissed, he is forced to reach out to a former colleague named Raffi for a less-official means of getting off the planet, and the CinC briefs Starfleet security about his claims of clandestine Romulan operations happening on Earth. Unfortunately, it seems that the head of security and her lieutenant are both in on the Romulan plot.</span>

								<p>The episode feels a little slower than the previous one, probably because it is still filling in a lot of prologue. The interspersed scenes of Laris expositing about the Zhat Vash and their forensic investigation at Dahj's apartment feel like they drag on for too long just to establish only two things: the proverbial boogeyman for the season, and that Dahj's sister isn't on Earth.</p>
								
								<p>The scene with Picard's doctor seems like it might have been meant for a cameo appearance for, say, Dr. Pulaski or something (although a cursory internet search doesn't support that). Instead, we get a character that seems important to Picard but has never been mentioned even once up to this point.</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p>With <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>, I did not want &ldquo;TNG Part 2.&rdquo; More importantly, Patrick Stewart did not want &ldquo;TNG Part 2.&rdquo; But, oh boy, all that many of the fans wanted was &ldquo;TNG Part 2&rdquo;, so I took quite a bit of perverse schadenfreude pleasure when this episode set up the hopes of fans &mdash; not once, but twice &mdash; and quickly dashed those hopes.</p>
								
								<p>The first was when Picard perfectly set up a plausible reason to get him back on a starship, in a uniform, and even accepting a demotion to Captain, just so everything could be almost like we remember it... and then the admiral comes down hard on him, which I think was the producers' way of saying &ldquo;This is not going to be TNG Part 2!!&rdquo;	The second time was when Zhaban tells Picard that he'll need support, a crew, and then suggests people like Riker, Worf, and La Forge. The fans were probably thinking, &ldquo;Okay, okay, they're going to do the mission off the books, but they'll at least get the old crew together!&rdquo; and then Picard was just like &ldquo;Nah.&rdquo;</p>
								
								<p>This series was never meant to be &ldquo;more TNG.&rdquo; I firmly believe that that doesn't mean you can't enjoy and appreciate it for what it is.</p>

								<p>This episode takes its time introducing two new characters, Raffi and Rios. We gather that Raffi hasn't been taking very good care of herself since she and Picard were ousted from Starfleet 14 years prior. Rios, on the other hand... well, he's a little bit more of a mystery. We know he was in Starfleet, and we know something terrible happened to his previous captain, but that's about it. Well, besides the fact that he has holograms of himself helping him to run the ship.</p>
								
								<p>We get a little bit of a fight scene about two-thirds of the way through to break up the monotony of all this introduction. Also, there's a bit of a mystery dangled in front of us in the form of Soji's interview with Ramdha. Still, the episode largely feels like more prologue, setting things up before the real adventure begins. I was relieved when the gang finally set course away from Earth &mdash; maybe there will be more plot development in the next episode, finally. (There won't be.)</p>

								<p>This episode's purpose is to tell a back story about the planet Vashti, and to introduce Elnor, nothing more. In fact, the scenes on the Borg artifact really aren't even necessary, except to remind us that Soji, Narek, and Narissa still exist.</p>
								
								<p>This episode feels, to me, like the most arduous one as far as furthering the plot of Season One. Part of the reason for that is because at the end of the previous episode, our heroes were warping off to adventure, but their trip to Freecloud is entirely interrupted by this side-quest to pick up Elnor.</p>
								
								<p>And let's talk about Elnor. I honestly think that someone on the show decided that they needed someone to be a sword-slinger to round out the ragtag group so they could have a different type of hand-to-hand action for future episodes, so they made this entire backstory about Vashti and the Qowat Milat just for him. It has little to no connection to any previous art, and I'm not saying that it has to, but it does weaken this story's standing in the universe. I could look back on this episode and forgive it if Elnor were to become a great and beloved character, but his use on the show is pretty much only twofold: swordplay and comedy relief. They frequently play on his naïveté from his sheltered upbringing as a comedy device.</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p>Finally, the space battle at the end was quite the contrivance just so they could tease Seven of Nine's involvement on the show, as if to say, &ldquo;If you didn't like this episode, we promise the next one will be better!&rdquo; (In fact, I rather like the next episode, but as we'll see, I'm not in the majority with that opinion.)</p>

							The gang finally arrives at Freecloud in search of Bruce Maddox, and they determine that he is under the tender mercies of someone named Bjayzl. Seven explains that Bjayzl likes to dismantle ex-Borg for profit, and when the group figures that they can't just grab their target, Seven suggests that they set up a trade: her for Maddox. Rios goes undercover as a flamboyant go-between to set up the deal, and Picard dons an eyepatch along with a comical French accent as the interested trader. When Bjayzl and Seven are finally face-to-face at a posh night club, it's revealed that the two know each other. Thirteen years prior, Bjayzl laid a trap for Icheb – Seven's adopted son – and dismantled him for his Borg components.<span class="spoilerContent"> Picard is aghast as Seven looks to seek deadly revenge on Bjayzl, and finally convinces her to stand down. They beam back to the ship with Maddox, and Seven says her goodbyes. She beams away and goes straight back to the bar to complete her vengeance. Maddox is receiving critical medical care on la Sirena and tells Picard that Dahj's sister, Soji, is on the Borg Artifact. Picard leaves and Jurati comes to Bruce's side. In the past, the two of them were having a romance, but now Jurati cries, saying that she's been shown something terrible and must atone for it, and she disconnects Bruce's life support, killing him.</span>

								<p>Finally, we're doing something! It seems like people didn't care for this episode, but I thought it was great. I rather enjoyed Seven playing the &ldquo;straight man&rdquo; while Picard emoted with his over-the-top French accent. Maybe people didn't care for the opening scene, and I have to agree that it seemed to mostly be there for shock value, but it does successfully convey why Seven would be so hellbent on revenge. Rios' flamboyant persona and Picard's ridiculous accent are a nice, humorous contrast to the gravity of Seven's burden.</p>
								
								<p>Elnor serves no purpose in this episode except to be awkward. Sure, he collects weapons and holds people at bay at one point, but anyone could have done that. And Jurati is mostly just there to have a panic attack about using the transporter. Why didn't Rios just have one of his myriad holograms do it?</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p>Well, Jurati does serve one more purpose in this episode. At the end, she shuts off Maddox's life support, killing him. She mumbles something about atonement, but it's definitely not at all clear why she did what she did. I have to admit, when I first saw this episode, I thought I had completely missed something because I was very confused by this scene. But her reasons for killing Maddox won't actually be explained until a later episode. Until then, Jurati's character will be all over the place and somewhat intolerable.</p>
								</div>
								
								<p>On IMDb, this is the lowest-rated episode of the season. Many reviewers object to the gory opening scene, and I agree that they probably could have toned it down a little bit. That objection then seems to spill over into the general feeling of the episode &ndash; that it's dark and contrary to the optimism many fans have come to expect from <em>Star Trek</em>. I assume that these critics probably didn't care much for <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, either. I think there's still plenty of optimism to be had in the Federation, but that doesn't mean there aren't parts of the galaxy that are still seedy and pessimistic. But once someone has decided they don't like the episode, that colors their thoughts on other elements of the story, like taking umbrage with Picard's ridiculous French accent which, under different circumstances, they might have found humorous.</p>
								
								<p>I'm not saying they're wrong. It's difficult to be impartial when you feel strongly about something, and I certainly have my own opinions on things that sway my decisions. My only concern, as I've said before, is that sometimes people deny themselves the opportunity to enjoy new <em>Trek</em> for what it <em>is</em>, because they're a little too hung up on what it <em>was</em>.</p>

								<p>It's Soji's big moment as Narek will finally help her to uncover the truth about who she is. From a strange recurring dream with orchids blocking her view, to her odd conversations with her mother, Soji starts to question everything. The tension builds as she discovers abnormalities about her own belongings. She starts to panic, and Narek helps her through a ritual meditation to unlock the secrets of her dream. As she walks the path, the panic and stress crescendo until she's finally able to push past the orchids for the big reveal...!</p>
								
								<p>...the problem is that we, the audience, already know that Soji is an android. I still think the episode does a very effective job of building the anticipation up to that last moment, but it is ultimately an epiphany for Soji, not the audience. As for the rest, it was nice to see the reunion between Picard and Hugh, and the episode does a pretty good job of addressing Picard's heavy apprehension about stepping foot on a Borg cube again.</p>
								
								<p>There are two things that I didn't care for in this installment. The scene between Rios and Jurati seems very out of place and is kind of annoying. I get that they're trying to display that Jurati has &ldquo;seen some stuff&rdquo; and is suffering from some serious psychological trauma, but I think that could have been accomplished much better with a different tactic. I suspect that someone decided that they needed to inject some sex-appeal into the episode, so this is what we ended up with. The other thing I wasn't a huge fan of: after Raffi successfully secures diplomatic credentials for Picard, the theme song from <em>The Next Generation</em> plays triumphantly in the background as if some great victory has been made. But the victory comes at a heavy cost for Raffi, and she had just finished trying to make light of drinking herself to death, as she is actively in the middle of a concerning bender. It doesn't feel like the right time for triumphant music to me.</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p>The ending sequence is interesting, at least. It's not clear why la Sirena couldn't just beam Picard and Soji off the cube, but Elnor somehow was able to transport the other direction. No matter, because there's a big deus ex machina spatial trajector in the secret queencell! And Elnor finally gets to do something by closing out the episode with his ominous line, &ldquo;Please friends, choose to live.&rdquo;</p>

							Picard and Soji have traveled to Nepenthe. Rios, Raffi, and Jurati are on board la Sirena and plan to meet up with Picard, but first they have to lose their tail, Narek. Elnor has decided to stay behind on the Borg cube to help Hugh. In a flashback to three weeks prior, we learn that Commodore Oh gave Jurati a tracking device that she promptly ingested, so Jurati is now painfully aware that she's the reason Rios can't evade Narek. Meanwhile, over on Nepenthe, Picard has a bittersweet reunion with Will Riker, Deanna Troi, and their daughter Kestra, at their home in the woods. Soji is having trouble coming to terms with the new knowledge that she is, in fact, and android. Kestra befriends her quickly, and they begin to form a bond, but Soji is still very skeptical that all of this could just be another mind game similar to the one Narek played on her.<span class="spoilerContent"> Finally, after a shower, some rest, and a meal, Soji decides to trust Picard and the others, so she describes the dream she had about the two red moons and lightning. This allows them to determine Soji's homeworld location, which will be their next destination. Over on the Borg cube, Elnor engages in hand-to-hand with Narissa in order to protect Hugh, but sadly, Narissa is successful in killing Hugh. Elnor retreats to a hiding place and finds a Fenris Ranger communications device, which he uses to call for help. Jurati, meanwhile, is wracked with guilt about being a human tracking device, and she doesn't want to be responsible for giving away Picard's position, so she injects herself with something that induces a coma and neutralizes the tracker. Finally, la Sirena is able to rendezvous with Picard.</span>

								<p>This episode is delightful, and it's a nice break from the Borg and the Romulans and space and all that stuff. Sometimes it's nice to settle down and just make some wood-fired pizza in the back yard! And do you know why the warmth and love displayed among Picard, Riker, and Troi works so well? It's because the actors are all dear friends and really do love each other. All those hugs were very much sincere.</p>
								
								<p>As for the other two plots, well, <em>*sigh*</em>. Obviously Jurati is tortured because of the events in the opening scene of this episode. Both because of what Commodore Oh showed her in the mind-meld, and also because she is the reason Narek keeps finding them. (You know, when Oh hands her the tracker saying &ldquo;Take this&rdquo;, Jurati immediately puts it in her mouth. I was half expecting Oh to be like &ldquo;No, wha&ndash; what are you doing? You don't <em>eat</em> it...&rdquo;) Anyway, Jurati takes a really long time to come around, and in the meantime we have to watch her eat and throw up cake like an idiot.</p>
								
								<p>And then there's the short Hugh/Elnor plot line, just to get in a little bit of hand-to-hand combat to offset the relaxing woodsy cabin plot. Okay, fine.<span class="spoilerContent"> But was it really necessary to kill off Hugh??? Couldn't he have just continued to live and do good work treating the xBs? What purpose did his death serve the story? Boo!</span></p>

It makes sense that Hugh and Seven might be friends, or at least be willing to help each other, since they are both ex-Borg. So it makes sense that Seven might have given Hugh one of her call-for-help thingies, too. So, it turns out that the one she gave to Picard was mostly just so that the audience would recognize the device when they saw it here, again.

							14 years ago, in an octonary star system, on Aia, &ldquo;The Grief World,&rdquo; eleven figures in black cloaks encircle a glowing altar. Among them are Narissa and Ramdha, and they experience what the Romulans call &ldquo;The Admonition.&rdquo; It warns of the Destroyers and the synthetic life forms that gave rise to them thousands of centuries ago. Narissa and Ramdha, as members of the Zhat Vash, are vowed to prevent it from happening again. The Admonition is the vision that Commodore Oh showed to Jurati and it has been the driving force behind her behavior until now. She awakens in sickbay on la Sirena, and she agrees to turn herself in for the murder of Bruce Maddox. Meanwhile, Rios has gone into hiding in his cabin immediately after beaming up Picard and Soji from Nepenthe. Something about the sight of Soji sent him on a downward spiral, and Raffi interrogates the five emergency holograms that run the ship to try and get to the bottom of it. Over on the Artifact, Seven of Nine takes control of the cube and the remaining Borg on board, in order to oust the Romulans.<span class="spoilerContent"> Unfortunately, most of the Borg are killed before the Romulans leave for Soji's homeworld, anyway. Rios finally explains that on the ibn Majid, he and his captain picked up two people in the Vayt sector, when suddenly the captain shot and killed them both, and later killed himself, as well. One of those two passengers was named Jana, and she looked identical to Soji. The gang discuss everything they've learned up to this point, and finally they change course and also head for Soji's homeworld.</span>

								<p>This is an important episode, with some great moments that actually made it difficult for me to decide which ones to use for the two episode images here. I wanted to include the scene with the five emergency holograms gathered in the château recreation, and also that photograph of Rios and his former captain. Watching Santiago Cabrera (Cris Rios) playing five characters in the same scene was delightful, especially with Raffi trying to wrangle them all to cooperate. Also, the scene with Seven of Nine taking control of the Borg cube was certainly a powerful one.</p>
								
								<p>On my first watch-through of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>, I had some trouble following certain elements of the story. Now, on my second watch-through, I'm filling in some of the gaps in my mind. It's a little easier now to understand everything that's happening because I already know what is coming, and I have come to realize that my confusion the first time through is justified. The story elements are often told out of order, so even on the second time through it's a little confusing. Some plot points that come up aren't fully explained until future episodes, so if you are only watching one episode per week (like I did, as the episodes were first released), it's easy to forget certain details that might have happened in the weeks prior.</p>
								
								<p>This episode seeks to help with that confusion, by summing up everything that has happened in these first eight episodes and teeing up what you need to know for the two-episode season finale. If you find yourself still confused, just go back and watch that scene toward the end of this episode where Picard, Rios, Raffi, Jurati, and Soji all sit around the table literally explaining everything &ndash; as many times as you need.</p>

							Picard and the gang exit the Borg trans-warp conduit at Soji's homeworld, along with Narek, who was tailing them. A space battle dogfight ensues, and then the Borg Artifact comes through the conduit, as well, just to make sure the opening scene gets everyone's attention. Then some giant space orchids attack and cause all three vessels to crash-land on the planet. After confirming that Seven and Elnor have survived, the gang arrives at a settlement where they find many identical android pairs. Soji warns the androids of the impending Romulan attack, and now she must figure out whether to run, hide, or stand her ground in a battle that could have devastating consequences.<span class="spoilerContent"> You see, Soji's counterpart, an android named Sutra, performed a Vulcan mind-meld on Jurati in order to experience the Admonition for herself. With a synthetic brain, she is able to understand the message with much more clarity than any organic mind could. It's a message from a superior alliance of synthetic life that offers their protection to any fellow synth who summons them. Sutra believes summoning these beings is their only hope to survive the attack, but it could mean the extinction of organic life. Oh, also, Altan Soong is there, tinkering with a golem that I'm sure won't be important later... and Narek is loose and probably up to no good.</span>

								<p>I am not sure how to describe this episode except <em>weird</em>. We have giant space orchids, we have androids performing mind-melds &ndash; which I thought required Vulcan telepathy and wasn't just &ldquo;something you can learn&rdquo; &ndash; we have a very awkward moment between Picard and Raffi, we have this weird little amphitheater where everyone gathers to further the plot like they're going to watch a little play or something, we have &ldquo;death by hummingbird brooch to the eye&rdquo;... and we have a little repeating gif of Maddox and Jurati making out.</p>
								
								<p>The gang spends all of 10 minutes on the Borg cube to confirm that Seven and Elnor are okay, and then they just leave them behind. Soong shows Jurati a &ldquo;golem&rdquo; in a strange little scene that is obviously only there to introduce the thing that will be important later. Saga gives Raffi a device to help fix la Sirena &ndash; a device which apparently runs on the power of ✨IMAGINATION✨. Do you see what I mean? This episode is <em>weird</em>.</p>

							<p><span class="spoilerContent"><strong>Act I:</strong> </span>The synths, specifically Soji, are building a beacon tower in order to contact the &ldquo;uber-synths,&rdquo; and Picard has been locked away so he can't meddle with the effort. Fortunately, Narek has had a change of heart and after collecting some grenades from the Borg Artifact, he meets with Rios and Raffi at la Sirena and suggests they work together to destroy the beacon. As they regain access to the settlement with a concealed grenade, Jurati has engineered a prison break for Picard and they head back to la Sirena. The Romulans are only minutes away, so Picard takes the ship into orbit, hoping to find some way to delay them until Starfleet can arrive.<span class="spoilerContent"> With time running out, Rios launches the grenade, but Soji is able to intercept it and prevent any damage to the tower. As the Romulan fleet arrives, some of the giant orchid defenses rise up to keep them busy for a little while, and Soji activates the beacon, opening a portal. Once the orchids are defeated, Jurati finds a way to create hundreds of echoes of la Sirena, again delaying the Romulan assault. When that ruse fails, Picard makes one last entreaty for Soji to change her mind. She does, shutting down the portal and preventing some nasty-looking mechanical tentacles from invading, and just in time for a fleet of Starfleet ships to arrive and protect the planet.</span></p>
							
							<div class="spoilerContent"><p><strong>Act II:</strong> Picard's heroism has come at a cost: his brain abnormality has finally reached a critical point. After the battle, he collapses and is beamed down to the planet where he can say his goodbyes before closing his eyes for the last time. Oddly, he opens them again in his château study, but there's a dark gray pall over everything. There, he meets Data, who explains that his consciousness has been reconstituted from a single neuron from B-4, by Bruce Maddox. They talk for a time, and Data finally says that Soong and Jurati have successfully transferred Picard's consciousness to the golem, so it is time for him to go. Data asks one last favor: to end his consciousness – he wants to experience the finiteness of life. And so, with his new android body, Picard grants his dear friend's request, disconnecting the components from the machine as Data listens to &ldquo;Blue Skies&rdquo; one last time. Finally, everyone gathers back on la Sirena and warps off to new adventures.</p></div>

								<p>Ooof, okay, let's get into this, shall we? We sort of have the elements of a finale, here. A big bad space fleet is on the way, time is running out, yadda yadda... but somehow it just doesn't quite feel right.</p>
								<p><span class="spoilerPlaceholder">Since this is the series finale, the rest of my thoughts are probably going to be spoilers.</span><span class="spoilerContent">First we have Soji, who was at first very skeptical at the idea of contacting the &ldquo;uber-synths,&rdquo; but is now hellbent on doing it for some reason. We have Elnor and Narek's really bad plan to do hand-to-hand combat with androids in order to distract them from Rios hesitating to throw a bomb, and they ultimately just fail. We have Jurati who is really angry at Soong for some reason, and who uses a magic ocarina-looking thing to conjure up hundreds of fake ships. And of course we have Soji who changes her mind <em>again</em> at the last moment, saving everyone from certain doom. Even General Oh, who has devoted her life to this very moment, a cause so deeply ingrained one might even call it &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; &ndash; even she decides to give up on the culmination of her life's work and just retreat back home. I don't believe that for a second. I believe she would have gone down fighting for her cause.</span></p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent"><p>Then, of course, we have Picard's death... but there's going to be 2 more seasons of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> so obviously he can't <em>STAY</em> dead. It's a good thing Jurati was able to finish Maddox's work on memory transfer in the few hours she was there. I'm just not sure what the benefit is to the overall story to do a dead-but-not-dead thing. Oh well. Finally, we do have a more fitting end for Data &ndash; at least, it provides more satisfying closure than his original death in <a href="../films/nemesis.html"><em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em></a>. I will give the writers props for that.</p>
								
								<p>Overall, it successfully bookends the season and wraps up the adventure of finding Data's &ldquo;children&rdquo; and saving not only them, but all of organic life, because obviously the stakes have to be galactic-level dire if Picard is going to get involved. The end.</p></div>

		<p>Season One of <em>Picard</em> suffers from jumbled storytelling and the introduction of elements that exist only long enough to further the plot. One example of the latter includes Doctor Naáshala Kunamadéstifee, who gets an introduction and a decent amount of screen-time in one episode, but is never seen again. Another example are the &ldquo;gradient badges&rdquo; worn by the workers on the Borg artifact. They were introduced and then never used, violating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun" target="_blank"><em>Chekhov's gun</em></a> principle. There is a split second where one of the badges lights up, so I suspect that their intended use for the story ended up on the cutting room floor. There's also that little Fenris SOS dongle that is introduced, just so we know what it is when Elnor conveniently finds another one on the Borg cube. Even poor Icheb was brought in, just to be thrown away again once he established Seven's motivations. And of course, there are the stupidly-convenient elements needed for the two-part finale, including the handheld magic imagination device, and the fact that a non-Vulcan android can somehow perform a Vulcan mind-meld.</p>
		
		<p>As for jumbled storytelling, well, the biggest problem is truly understanding Jurati's motivations throughout the season. I understand and appreciate the decision to keep the audience in the dark about it, just as Picard was in the dark, but I don't think they made it clear enough just how tortured she was by what she saw. She sees the vision in episode 3, but we don't learn about it until episode 8. In the 4-episode interim, she just seems weird, quirky, awkward, and frankly, incompetent. Maybe instead of that scene where she randomly decides &ldquo;maybe sex will make me feel better!&rdquo;, maybe they could have done a better job of showing how tortured she really is by what she saw. When we finally do find out what happened to Jurati, it's a little difficult to go back and remember everything she did over so many episodes to try and reconcile her actions in our minds. Because of this, I found Jurati to be truly intolerable the first time I watched this season. On the second watch-through &ndash; now that I know her motivations ahead of time &ndash; I actually found her to be less annoying than the first time through.</p>
		
		<p>In the opposite vein, almost an entire episode is devoted to Narek helping Soji to resurface her memories until she comes to the grand realization that she is some sort of artificially-constructed being, not human. But we, the audience, already knew that, so the epiphany isn't nearly as impactful.</p>
		
		<p>On the plus side, this season brings back much-loved characters that we haven't seen in quite some time. It has, I think, a really good balance of new material and nostalgia &ndash; effectively entertaining long-time fans while also distinguishing itself as something new and unique, and not just &ldquo;TNG Part 2.&rdquo; While mostly a dramatic story, there are elements of humor that are mostly well-placed (although comedy relief in the form of Jurati or Elnor was at times ham-fisted). Overall, it was definitely an enjoyable ride, but it is still the weakest of this show's three seasons, in my humble opinion.</p>
