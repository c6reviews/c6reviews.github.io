			<p>The third and final season of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> takes on a cadence of three episodes followed by a mini-finale, another three episodes followed by another mini-finale, and then the two-part grand finale. Without spoiling anything, Beverly Crusher sends a distress call to Picard because she's being pursued by unknown enemies, and there was also a big bad weapon stolen from the Daystrom Institute. Uh, there is a villain... and a conspiracy involving the Changelings... and that's really all I can say!</p>

							Beverly Crusher sends a desperate distress call to Picard after not having spoken to him for over 20 years. To the rescue, Picard and Riker take the USS Titan-A, along with Captain Shaw, first officer Commander Annika Hansen, and helmsman Sidney La Forge, Geordi's daughter. Shaw is clearly not thrilled by Picard and Riker's visit. Meanwhile, Raffi is<span class="spoilerContent"> working for Starfleet Intelligence</span> in search of information about some portal technology stolen from the Daystrom Institute<span class="spoilerContent">, but she is too late to save a devastating attack on a Starfleet recruiting facility. On Beverly's ship, Picard and Riker find the doctor in a stasis tube, being guarded by a young man in his 20s who says he is Crusher's son and that they are being hunted, just as a big bad ship appears menacingly before them</span>.

								<p>There's something I immediately like about the atmosphere in this episode, from the opener on Beverly's ship, to Picard's study, to Guinan's bar, to Raffi's scenes on M'Talas Prime. I don't know if it's the lighting, the way it's shot, the music, or what... but it definitely works. However, when Picard and Riker first arrive on the Titan, we see, once again, &ldquo;The Hallway&rdquo; which we haven't seen since <a href="pic-s2.html#e01">S2E01</a>, but believe me, we'll see <em>too much</em> of it this season. In case you forgot when I mentioned it last time, this generic Starfleet ship corridor is used ad nauseam this season. It's shot from different angles and sometimes has various props strewn about it, but it's always the same damn corridor. Over and over and over. I get it, they were on a tight budget, but give us a break! Don't worry, I'll make sure to point out every time it's used.</p>

								<p>Then I was actually a bit disappointed when the Titan bridge was just a slight redress of the Stargazer bridge from Season 2. In fact, I'm not even sure there was a redress... they look identical. Well, setting that aside, the drawn-out launch sequence with gratuitous views of the ship and the accompanying music is sort of a <em>Star Trek</em> signature, reminiscent of the original films. Even the most critical viewers of this series have to admit that this <em>is</em> &ldquo;<em>Star Trek</em>&rdquo;.</p>
								
								<p>It's delightful to see Seven of Nine in a Starfleet uniform, and long overdue, I would say. Then we meet Captain Shaw, a foil for our heroes Picard and Riker. You know, I took umbrage with the reporter in <a href="pic-s1.html#e01">S1E01</a> because she antagonized Picard, and while Shaw does the same here... there's something compelling about him. From the moment he greeted them at dinner with, "...your reputations proceeded you so far into the room that I started early," we knew he was going to be disagreeable. He is rude, to be sure, but his reasons for refusing to change course are sound, and actor <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick" target="_blank">Todd Stashwick</a> does a wonderful job with the character in this and future episodes to come. When dinner ends abruptly, Riker, Picard, and Seven exit out through &ldquo;The Hallway.&rdquo;</p>
																
								<div class="spoilerContent"><p>We get some more of Raffi's story, including a conversation with her mysterious handler and a devastating attack on a Starfleet recruitment center, which definitely ups the stakes. We'll find out more about how her story comes around to merge with Picard's in future episodes. Finally, we are introduced to a big, nasty-looking enemy ship and its accompanying sound effect using an instrument called a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_beam" target="_blank">blaster beam.</a>&rdquo; <em>To be continued...</em></p></div>

								<li>There are numerous references to the original motion pictures throughout the episode, including musical motifs (notably composer <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/James_Horner" target="_blank">James Horner</a>'s violin trills during the Titan launch sequence, reminiscent of <a href="../films/ii-twok.html"><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em></a>), the boatswain's whistle (nearly identical to the one used in <a href="../films/vi-tuc.html"><em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em></a>), and Beverly's jacket with the large white collar (reminiscent of Carol Marcus's jacket from <a href="../films/ii-twok.html"><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em></a>).</li>
								<li>The computer in Beverly's room reads aloud Picard's log entry on stardate 43996.2, during their encounter with the Borg in <a href="../tng/tng-s3.html#e26">TNG 3x26 &amp; 4x01: The Best of Both Worlds</a>. Oddly, there are two entries displayed on the screen, neither of which are from that episode. They are, instead, stardate 45236.4 from <a href="../tng/tng-s5.html#e07">TNG 5x07: Unification I</a>, and stardate 41153.7, from <a href="../tng/tng-s1.html#e01">TNG 1x01/02: Encounter at Farpoint</a>.</li>
								<li>Among Beverly's possessions is a tablet/plaque naming her Medical Away Team as Honorary Citizens of Cor Coroli V <span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:x-small">[sic]</span>. While we never saw the origin of this story on screen, it is mentioned only once in <a href="../tng/tng-s3.html#e18">TNG 3x18: Allegiance</a>. The planet was facing a plague which was successfully eliminated by Dr. Crusher and her team, and the incident was later classified by Starfleet.  There is a real-life star named &ldquo;Cor Caroli,&rdquo; suggesting that this plaque has a spelling error.</li>
								<li>Beverly also has a box labeled &ldquo;Lt Cmdr Jack R Crusher,&rdquo; who is her late husband.</li>
								<li>Among Picard's treasured possessions in his study are his Ressikan flute from <a href="../tng/tng-s5.html#e25">TNG 5x25: The Inner Light</a> which he briefly holds, the tapestry given to him by the natives of Mintaka III in <a href="../tng/tng-s3.html#e04">TNG 3x04: Who Watches the Watchers</a> draped over the back of his chair, and the Kurlan naiskos gifted to him by Professor Galen in <a href="../tng/tng-s6.html#e20">TNG 6x20: The Chase</a>, on the desk as he hand-writes cards that evening.</li>
								<li>&ldquo;Picard 4 7 Alpha Tango&rdquo; is the authorization code that Picard used in <a href="../films/firstcontact.html"><em>Star Trek: First Contact</em></a> to gain access to a restricted communiqué and also to set the self-destruct.</li>
								<li>Non-reference: &ldquo;Myriad codec&rdquo; and Riker's memory of its use on Rigel VII is not a reference to anything that had previously happened on screen.</li>
								<li>Non-reference: Beverly's codeword &ldquo;Hellbird&rdquo; and the so-named virus that Riker talks about is not a reference to anything that had previously happened on screen.</li>
								<li>During the Titan's launch sequence, an officer reports, &ldquo;Metaphasic shields at the ready.&rdquo; This is a nod to <a href="../tng/tng-s6.html#e22">TNG 6x22: Suspicions</a>, which was an episode primarily focused on Beverly Crusher and her desire to bring scientists together to work on this shield technology, which was experimental at the time. Obviously the designs have been refined and implemented on modern Starfleet ships.</li>
								<li class="spoilerPlaceholder">( +1 spoiler )</li>
								<li class="spoilerContent">The &ldquo;Red Lady&rdquo; is a statue of Rachel Garrett, who was the captain of the U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-C, only ever seen in the TNG episode <a href="../tng/tng-s3.html#e15">TNG 3x15: Yesterday's Enterprise</a>, which tells the story of the event responsible for sending Tasha Yar into the past, eventually leading to the birth of the hybrid Human-Romulan, Sela.</li>

								<li>Picard doesn't recognize Beverly's codeword &ldquo;Hellbird,&rdquo; and Riker explains that it references a virus that got into the Enterprise-D's computers while Picard was... well... busy being Locutus, as if that explains why Picard wouldn't have known about it. Uh, would there not have been any logs? You know, records of what happened on the Enterprise during that time? Wouldn't Picard have probably reviewed those logs to get caught up? (Maybe it was too hard for him to review the logs considering the trauma he went through?)</li>
								<li>When Picard and Riker finish up their conversation at their bar table and start to leave, the camera focuses on an unknown man sitting at the bar (listed in the credits only as &ldquo;Dark Haired Man&rdquo;). It seems like he was maybe listening into Picard's conversation, and then he ominously drops a model of a Galaxy-class starship into his drink and leaves. These are all obvious cues to the audience that this is a bad guy. Just keep that in mind for now, I'm going to talk more about it in the Nitpickery section of the fourth episode.</li>
								<li>Seven says that the ensign guarding &ldquo;Shuttle 3&rdquo; will be called away, and later Ensign La Forge says there's an unauthorized launch from &ldquo;Shuttlebay 3.&rdquo;  I suppose Shuttle 3 could be in Shuttlebay 3... and I suppose Shuttlebay 3 could be the name of the main shuttlebay from where the craft is seen departing...</li>
								<li>Raffi asks the computer to search on the term &ldquo;red lady&rdquo; as a name of a vessel. The computer responds with a vessel named the &ldquo;Red Lady,&rdquo; followed by a second result about a former member of the Tal Shiar, who clearly is not a vessel... and that's it. Raffi, having done 23 searches, talks to herself about the Red Lady not being a buyer or a seller or a ship... making it seem like she's really only done 3 searches.</li>

								<p>Well let's see, we start off with a flashback of Jack doing some less-than-legal business on the Eleos, and then jump back to the present where he and the others could really use some assistance against the big scary ship that presently has them trapped. Shaw finally concedes and comes to the rescue &ndash; their maneuver to break the tractor beam was pretty cool. Raffi is upset by the terror attack on the recruitment center, and even more upset that she's been taken off the case. So far, everything is mostly just necessary story.</p>
								
								<p>Next we have Raffi meeting up with her ex-husband, Jae, who must be one of the most selfish people in the galaxy. I get it, he thinks this &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; is all in Raffi's head, based on her past... but that's a pretty big assumption to make if you're going to make the ultimatum of &ldquo;you can come back to your family OR you can go save the galaxy from certain doom.&rdquo; What a jerk.</p>
								
								<p>Finally, we get our introduction to this season's antagonist: Captain Vadic (played by <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Amanda_Plummer" target="_blank">Amanda Plummer</a>) on board her big, bad ship, the Shrike. And let me say, her performance in this and future episodes is wonderful. She really <em>feels like</em> a <em>Star Trek</em> villain. Her poetic speeches and gleeful laughter are going to be a joy this season.</p>
							
								<p>Raffi meets Sneed, who I found amusing, mostly because he was played by <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Aaron_Stanford" target="_blank">Aaron Stanford</a>. &ldquo;The Hallway&rdquo; only makes one appearance in this episode, as security is dispatched after Jack Crusher's escape and Seven walks to the transporter room. And that's about all I have to say about this one! Besides the two big reveals toward the end of the episode and Plummer's enjoyable performance, the rest of the episode is just necessary story. I'm marking this as average but... a good average, if that makes sense.</p>

Ultimately, Picard waves this off and doesn't think his relationship with Jack is salvageable.

Picard urges Riker to go on the offensive numerous times, but each time Riker shuts him down, opting for a defensive posture instead. When Riker finally takes Picard's advice, the Shrike uses the Titan's own weapons against it, causing it to sink helplessly into the gravity well in the center of the nebula.</span>

								<p>It is time for Picard and Beverly to have &ldquo;the talk&rdquo; about Jack, and that talk understandably turns into a bit of an argument. And it's a good argument, because they both have strong, valid points. I particularly like Beverly's line, &ldquo;As a mother, your whole being is about protecting your child. I... I thought I could protect mine. I didn't know if I could protect yours.&rdquo; It is true that being Picard's son does potentially paint a target on your back from numerous former enemies across the galaxy. We also get the lame explanation for Jack's accent being that he went to school in London and &ldquo;never shook it&rdquo; which is, ugh, okay whatever.</p>
								
								<p>The B-plot of this episode is Worf getting a formal introduction and teaming up with Raffi to dig deeper into the portal weapon that was stolen from Daystrom and used on the Starfleet recruitment center, and this duo is fantastic together. Who knew that Worf, of all people, would become a hilarious comedy relief in the form of deadpan one-liners. I love it! And it's such smarter humor than Jurati's clumsy incompetence.</p>
															
								<p>&ldquo;The Hallway&rdquo; is seen several times this episode. Jack takes it in an attempt to get to the bridge during red alert. Security runs through it a few times in different action sequences. They try to shake things up now and then with that three-way corridor intersection set piece that was used for the brig in the previous episode... and to be fair, they used the same corridors over and over again in many other <em>Trek</em> shows, so I'm not sure why this one bothers me so much. There's just something about it...</p>
								
								<p>The rest of this episode is mostly a game of cat-and-mouse between the Titan and the Shrike in the nebula, which is fun in its own way, except for this weird disagreement between Riker and Picard about what strategy to use. I mean, at its core, I just don't like seeing our heroes and old friends arguing. But beyond that, I am not really clear what each man's motivations are for their points of view, nor what storytelling necessity this argument effects. (And yes, that is an intentional use of the lesser-used definition of the verb &ldquo;effects&rdquo; so don't come at me.) Maybe the next episode will explain it. (It doesn't.)</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">								
								<p>Oh right, we also get our first glimpse of the red door this episode. This is going to be an annoying little mystery for the next five episodes until they finally explain it in Episode 9, so don't get too hung up on it for now.</p>

								<li>The item that Seven fiddles with in her quarters is a camper's mini butane stove...</li>
								<li>It bothers me – but only slightly – that they perform defibrillation shocks on Jack and that the accompanying sound effect is of a present-day defibrillator. I get that it is a sound that we have all become familiar with as part of TV medical dramas, and it helps to signal to the watcher the severity of the situation. But... I mean, come on... this is <em>Star Trek</em>.</li>
								<li>I can't figure out Picard's need to go on offense with the Shrike. We already know that the Shrike greatly outclasses the Titan, so I don't feel like sneaking up behind it is enough of an advantage. Picard later says that Riker's strategy keeps failing and that's why they need to try something different, insisting they go on the offensive again. But they <em>are</em> trying something different. Riker's strategy failed because of the verterium leak &ndash; now that the leak is sealed, Riker's strategy has a perfectly good chance of succeeding.</li>
								<li>Why didn't Rikka just... shapeshift himself away from Raffi and Worf? Worf suggests that he didn't want to &ldquo;reveal his true nature,&rdquo; but I don't really think it would have changed much if he had. And look at the alternative: Now he's dead AND he's revealed his true self.</li>

								<p>This episode effectively serves as a mid-season mini-finale. I don't think it will really spoil anything to tell you that the ship and crew make it safely out of harm's way (at least for now) while we learn more about our characters, their pasts, and their present motivations. On top of that, the story is an homage to the first adventure of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D in the series premiere of <em>The Next Generation</em>. It's wonderfully done and it reminds you that there is beauty in the universe.</p>
								
								<p>As I mentioned in the previous episode, I can't figure out Picard and Riker's separate motivations for their differing strategies. Riker opens this episode with some explanation about his feelings (or lack thereof) as he watched his son's coffin being lowered into the ground but... that could have been years ago, and it's unclear why it's affecting him so much now. I like that they're trying to give Riker some depth here, but it doesn't quite do it for me.</p>
								
								<p>There is zero Raffi/Worf storyline in this episode, and despite my wanting to see more of them, I think their absence here is fine &ndash; the focus here really was on the Titan story. That story includes Shaw's traumatic memories of Wolf 359 and his survivor's guilt. Finally, we have an explanation for why Shaw has been such a jerk all this time, including why he insists that Seven go by her human name. Honestly, I think <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick" target="_blank">Todd Stashwick</a> has done a wonderful job of portraying Shaw as a jerk, and yet somehow he manages to make the audience still kind of like him for some reason.</p>
								
								<p>Seven encounters the Changeling on Deck 5, Corridor 8, also known as... &ldquo;The Hallway.&rdquo; These Changelings are considerably... &ldquo;fleshier&rdquo; than the ones we were used to from <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>. At first I thought this was just a style choice, the result of 24 years of advancements in CGI &ndash; but we do actually get an in-universe explanation later, in episode 7 of this season.</p>
																
								<div class="spoilerContent"><p>And the episode ends with a stinger involving the red door again, just to remind us that there's something very strange going on with Jack. This time we can clearly hear a female voice saying, &ldquo;Find me.&rdquo;</p></div>

									<li>The title of this episode is a reference to the Kobayashi Maru, a notorious exam at Starfleet Academy designed to evaluate how a cadet would perform in a no-win scenario. James Kirk famously defeated the test by cheating and reprogramming the computer to give him a way to win, saying that he doesn't believe in a no-win scenario.</li>
									<li>The first cadet's question to Picard is about a never-before-mentioned run-in Picard had with the Hirogen. Other cadets ask if he ever found out how the Hirogen got to the quadrant and if Janeway offered any advice. This references the fact that the Hirogen originate in the Gamma Quadrant and were first encountered by the USS Voyager under Janeway's command in <a href="../voy/voy-s4.html#e15">VOY 4x15: Hunters</a>. (They technically make their first appearance one episode before that, but only in brief conversation on a viewscreen.)</li>
									<li>When Seven searches the Changeling crewmember's cabin, we catch a glimpse of a Vulcan kal-toh game, first introduced in <a href="../voy/index.html"><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em></a> as an activity enjoyed by Tuvok.</li>
									<li>When Shaw explains to Seven how the Changelings use a &ldquo;pot&rdquo; to rest in, he calls up a file on his PADD which includes images of Constable Odo and his bucket from <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>.</li>
									<li>When Picard tells the cadets at Ten Forward Avenue about the Tamarians' language being based on metaphor, he is telling the story of the Next Generation episode <a href="../tng/tng-s5.htmle#e02">TNG 5x02: Darmok</a>.</li>
									<li>In the holodeck, Shaw tells his traumatic perspective of the Battle of Wolf 359. The story of this dire battle is told in <a href="../tng/tng-s3.html#e26">TNG 3x26 &amp; 4x01: The Best of Both Worlds</a>, where Picard &ndash; as Shaw puts it &ndash; sets the world on fire.</li>
									<li>When Picard, Beverly, and Jack explain the nebular &ldquo;womb&rdquo; to Riker, Beverly says they've encountered species that thrive in the vacuum of space, and Picard says &ldquo;Farpoint.&rdquo; This, of course, refers to the season premiere of Star Trek TNG, <a href="../tng/tng-s1.html#e01">TNG 1x01/02: Encounter at Farpoint</a>. Indeed, the conclusion of this episode is an homage to that first adventure of the Enterprise&#8209;D crew.</li>

								<li>It is established in <a href="../voy/index.html"><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em></a> that the holodecks run on an independent power source, separate and incompatible from the rest of the ship. Still, it is a very convenient plot point in so many <em>Trek</em> episodes that you really have to do your best to just shrug it off.</li>
								<li>Now that we know the Changelings are involved, I want to briefly revisit &ldquo;Dark Haired Man&rdquo; from Episode 1 of this season and point out that we never see Dark Haired Man ever again. Now, sure, I guess he could be the Changeling who is now impersonating different people on board the Titan... but the fact that we never see that original guy again sort of violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun" target="_blank"><em>Chekhov's gun</em></a> principle. Why introduce Dark Haired Man in an ominous moment of foreshadowing if we don't see him again and can't connect him to any of his potential future forms? For all we know, Dark Hared Man was just a random bar patron who had enough of his little Galaxy-class model ship and has nothing to do with the story!</li>
								<li>Picard, Crusher, and Jack present a viable &ndash; albeit risky &ndash; plan to Riker to escape their impending doom in the nebula's gravity well. He dismisses it, saying that they'll have to channel energy to the thrusters, draining life support in minutes. So... he's saying that rather than risking a chance to escape and dying within minutes if they fail, he'd rather have a 100% chance of death in a few hours.</li>
								<li>In the same conversation, Riker wants to stick to &ldquo;Starfleet Protocol&rdquo; which says they should do nothing and wait to be rescued. Picard points out that no one is coming to rescue them. Indeed, if rescue were possible, Vadic should be trying to rescue them. Her goal is to obtain Jack &ndash; she never wanted him to go down with the ship. Even if Riker has changed in the last 20 years, this seems very out-of-character for him. I think they try to explain this away, suggesting that Riker wants more time to record his message for Deanna, which he still hasn't done. But that's really terribly selfish of him. Riker says, &ldquo;I cannot choose certain death&rdquo; but that's exactly what he's doing! I hate this scene!</li>

								<p>The episode opens with yet another reminder that something very strange is going on with Jack. This time, he hallucinates killing the bridge crew, and then his eyes turn red as a female voice says, &ldquo;come home.&rdquo; Still no real clues as to what's going on here. I was trying to think of other times when there were glowing red eyes in <em>Star Trek</em>, and all I could come up with were the Pah-wraiths from <a href="../ds9/index.html"><em>DS9</em></a>. Could they be related to what's happening? (Spoiler alert: No, they aren't.)</p>
								
								<p>Early in the episode, Picard meets Beverly and Jack in... THE HALLWAY. Later, Shaw, Picard, and Riker meet the security officer from the Intrepid in... THE HALLWAY. And the security officer from the Intrepid prepares to leave from... THE HALLWAY.</p>
								
								<p>Raffi and Worf return this episode, much to my delight. Unfortunately, the business with the weirdo Vulcan is kind of just filler. Yeah, they needed a lead to get them back on the trail of what was taken from Daystrom, but did it really have to be this guy? He finally talks about the &ldquo;highly sophisticated AI&rdquo; which guards the place and, what luck, he just happens to have a program to bypass it!</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p> The real adventure in this episode is the surprise return of Ro Laren, and the reveal that Worf and Raffi are working for her to uncover this large conspiracy by the Changelings. It was good to see her again, and I was glad to witness her reconciliation with Picard. Then, just like they did with Hugh and Icheb, they kill her off. Sigh. Finally, Jack goes bonkers and kills four security guards who all turned out to be Changelings. Where? You guessed it! The Hallway!</p>

								<p>It's finally time to infiltrate Daystrom Station, which is apparently where Section 31 keeps all of its goodies, but... there is something about a space station that doesn't scream &ldquo;security&rdquo; to me. It seems to me that the clandestine branch of Starfleet Intelligence would be more, I don't know, clandestine? It seems much more likely that they'd keep their things in various locations, undisclosed locations, obfuscated locations... not just a space station, the coordinates of which are apparently public knowledge. And also probably somewhere that has 24/7 security, not just &ldquo;Yeah Starfleet checks on it every hour or so.&rdquo; I guess they try to explain this by saying that all they really need is this &ldquo;astonishingly lethal AI system&rdquo; to protect it, but that seems to be an internal security system. What is keeping a fleet of ships from coming by and just blowing the station up?</p>
								
								<p>Security deficiencies aside, we're finally going to find out what this AI security system is that they've been teasing. Now, it's important to know that Daniel Davis's return as James Moriarty was <em>advertised</em> before Season 3 even came out, so we knew he was coming, we just didn't know exactly how he would fit in to the story.<span class="spoilerContent"> And, I'm afraid, this role was a bit of a letdown. Sadly, this isn't <em>the</em> James Moriarty from two iconic episodes of <em>The Next Generation</em>, this is a copy, a memory. It was a brief interaction that I'm still glad I got to see, but it would have been so much more satisfying if this were somehow the real McCoy. On the other hand, the musical notes, the distant echoing whistling, and the footage from the original series premiere of <em>The Next Generation</em>... that was beautiful.</span></p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent"><p>However, that leads me to another reason I think Adam Soong and Kore should have been left out of Season 2. The moment leading up to the Data/Lore/etc. golem reveal would have been much more effective if we hadn't seen Spiner's face at all since Season 1. Also detracting from this reveal is, well, Data has died twice now, and we just keep bringing him back. Yeah, the crew wouldn't be complete without Data, but maybe you shouldn't have killed him off a second time in Season 1, then! Part of the problem, I think, is that they weren't sure if <em>Picard</em> was going to be picked up for the three seasons they had planned for, so there was a possibility that if it didn't perform well, it might have been canceled after the first season. In that case, I think they wanted to be sure that they gave Data a more satisfying send-off than when we last saw him in <em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em>. Also, if they had been canceled after the first season, there is a real possibility that they would have just killed Picard and that would have been his final mission. No golem, no new body to keep on trekkin' with. Can you imagine??</p></div>
								
								<p>The other part of this episode is focused on Geordi and his daughters, which I did find interesting. It's good to see that La Forge settled down and had a family, what with all of his failed relationships in <em>TNG</em>. There was some conflict among them, which was a little off-putting, but it did feel real. Families are rarely perfect, even in the 25th century, and Geordi's concern for his daughters is genuine and very realistic. Both of the major plotlines in this episode provide an incredible amount of fan-service, which I am definitely not complaining about! At Daystrom Station, we have tons of little easter eggs for fans to geek-out over, and of course Geordi works at the fleet museum, which is a great excuse to just show us a bunch of old ships that the fans love and miss. That is why the &ldquo;References&rdquo; section below is going to be so long.</p>

									<li>Picard was first diagnosed with the structural defect in <a href="../tng/tng-s7.html#e25">TNG 7x25/26: All Good Things...</a> that led to his Irumodic Syndrome.</li>
									<li>Worf and Raffi speak of the Dominion War and the Starfleet-made virus that was weaponized against the Changelings. Picard goes on to say that Starfleet eventually delivered the cure to the Great Link. This retelling of a major story arc in <a href="../ds9/index.html"><em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em></a> is not entirely accurate. The virus was engineered by Section 31 which, though technically a part of Starfleet, works autonomously and without oversight by Starfleet Command. Further, the cure was stolen from Section 31 by Julian Bashir and Miles O'Brien in <a href="../ds9/ds9-s7.html#e23">DS9 7x23: Extreme Measures</a> via questionable and extra-legal means with the goal of curing Odo, who had fallen victim to the virus. The cure was only provided to the rest of the Changelings by Odo's decision to do so, in exchange for the Changelings putting an end to the war. Vadic will set the record straight in the next episode.</li>

								<p>I love this episode; in fact, it might be my favorite of the entire series. I love Vadic's backstory and how it sheds a new, sinister light on the Dominion War. Amanda Plummer does a fantastic job and is so convincing as a tortured, bordering-on-mad villain. This is probably my favorite part, actually. Not just the story, but the way it's told, with the eerie whistling refrain of &ldquo;Three Blind Mice&rdquo; and the sheer calm of Plummer's delivery mixed with the occasional giddy laugh. I also enjoyed the Data/Lore bits, and I found Geordi's pleas with him to be highly evocative. And I especially loved the piano/cello piece that underscores the entire last act, how it seamlessly transitions from a poignant speech to hand-to-hand action and back.</p>
								
								<p>Now, it seems this episode isn't as popular among IMDb users and others, but I really think the whole crew went above and beyond for this episode. The writing, the acting, the direction, the music &ndash; everything was on point. It really feels like a crucial part of the story, a turning point, and then, well, there's the ending, promising more to come.</p>
								
								<p>There is a bit too much technobabble to explain Data and Lore's situation here, but it is at least necessary to the story. There's also an awful lot of &ldquo;The Hallway&rdquo; mixed in with that three-way intersection set in this episode... but if those are my only objections, I'd say this is still one of the best episodes this series has to offer.</p>
							
								<div class="spoilerContent"><p>Okay, a few more objections, I guess. I feel like there was a scene missing that explained <em>why</em> they hooked up the half-evil android to the ship so he could take it over. Also, the number and severity of security failures that had to happen to allow Vadic to take over the ship was something I had to overlook, but it was quite an effective cliffhanger. I definitely want to see the next episode A.S.A.P. Also, here's what we know about Jack so far: He keeps seeing a red door, and dark red vines all over the place. His eyes glow red. And now he can apparently get into other people's heads and control them. Hmm, none of these are really good clues to the truth. I thought that,  as an avid <em>Star Trek</em> fan, I could piece things together and figure out what was up with him but, no such luck up to this point.</p></div>

								<p>This episode is another mini-finale before the final two-episode grand finale. Despite my love of the previous episode and how it set things up for this one, this episode actually feels like it lost just a bit of the momentum that we got before it. It's still a great episode, but I couldn't rate this one quite as high as the previous one. Vadic has her henchmen torture and kill various crewmembers throughout the ship while she holds the bridge crew hostage until Jack surrenders himself. They try really hard to make Vadic as evil as possible in this episode, having her psychologically torture a few of the crew, making them think she's going to execute them just before she callously executes an entirely different crewmember.<span class="spoilerContent"> This is necessary, of course, to make her eventual defeat all the more satisfying. Still, it didn't feel like it was quite <em>enough</em>.</span></p>
								
								<p>One of the elements to this episode that is both good and not-so-good is the Data/Lore fight. On the one hand, the idea is great &ndash; bringing back Lore and finally reconciling him and Data in one last conflict. The dialogue and music that accompanies this part is good, too. But on the other hand, it's not really the Data and Lore that we know, <em>is it?</em> It's sort of a construct, a <em>concept</em> of Data and Lore. Further, their feud takes place in what I'm going to call their &ldquo;mind palace,&rdquo; which is a formless blue-white void (that conveniently turns red to inform the audience when bad things happen). I wish there had been more time and money put into this space. What if these scenes took place on a recreation of their &ldquo;birth&rdquo; place, the lab on Omicron Theta from <a href="../tng/tng-s1.html#e13">TNG 1x13: Datalore</a>, or in Noonien Soong's lab from 
								<a href="../tng/tng-s4.html#e03">TNG 4x03: Brothers</a>, or the Borg compound from <a href="../tng/tng-s6.html#e26">TNG 6x26 &amp; 7x01: Descent</a>? These are places where Data and Lore interacted before, and any of them would be a far more interesting place than this empty void. If it were me, I would have taken some of the Riker/Troi story away, and probably greatly shortened the last scene, in order to give more time to the Data/Lore story that it needed and deserved.</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent"><p>Deborah Kampmeier directed this episode and the previous one, and considering how much I liked the last episode, I was surprised to find something to complain about regarding this episode's direction. Toward the end, we finally get Picard, Riker, Worf, Troi, Data, Geordi, and Crusher sitting around a table for the first time in over twenty years, and there is not one single wide shot that captures everyone in the same frame during that scene. Oh, there is <em>almost</em> one, but Troi is sitting too close to the table, completely blocking our view of Worf. This was such an important gathering &ndash; the director should have been sure to get the perfect shot with everyone around the table.</p>

								<p>And of course, that last scene. Finally going to see what's behind that red door! PSYCH! Tune in next time to find out what's behind this suspense-manufacturing device!</p></div>

								<p>Well, this is it, folks. We finally find out what Jack's deal is and what's behind the red door, after they've been teasing it since Episode 3. It will set up the story for this two-part finale, so with that, I'll put the rest of this section behind the spoiler shield except to say... that &ldquo;sub-level maintenance corridor&rdquo; is just THE HALLWAY again with a bunch of boxes strewn threw it. You aren't fooling anyone!</p>
								
								<div class="spoilerPlaceholder"><p>( spoiler content hidden )</p></div>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p>On my first watch-through of this, I didn't quite grasp or appreciate that this was the fractured Borg's last attempt to assimilate the Federation through their biological artifact and via controlling the &ldquo;Fleet Formation&rdquo; system. It's a little hard to track partly because the Borg stuff is a CGI mess that is difficult to connect, and partly because it required a good bit of exposition, and partly because I was confused about the status of the Borg after Season 2. You can see more of my thoughts on the Borg's disposition on my <a href="../theborg/index.html">Borg</a> topic guide.</p>
								
								<p>Looks like there's a new Fleet Admiral in town! Can you imagine if, instead of Shelby, it had still been Admiral Clancy? What if she were the one making that speech for Frontier Day? &ldquo;... a crew of 83 souls embarked on a journey. One of bravery, perseverance and sacrifice that would lead to the birth of what we know today as Starfleet. And I think I speak for everyone when I say, shut the f*** up, Picard!&rdquo;</p>
								
								<p>I'll be completely honest, and I'm not going to make any friends saying this: I <em>love</em> that the gang is back together for one more adventure, and when I saw them all standing on the bridge of the Enterprise&#8209;D again, I thought, &ldquo;Oh. Well, I don't know that I needed <em>this</em>.&rdquo; I was more than content to enjoy this adventure with my favorite crew, I just don't feel like I needed this overt display of nostalgia. I mean, the bridge isn't even in the configuration we last saw it in <em>Star Trek Generations</em>, it's been downgraded back to the way it looked in <em>The Next Generation</em>, making it even more obvious that this has specifically been done for nostalgic reasons. It's so departed from the rest of this show's aesthetic that there was an absolutely necessary one-liner that had to be made about the carpet. Still, there's one episode to go, and I'm happy to go down this path because I trust they'll do it right.</p></div>

							<p>With Earth's defenses under attack by the assimilated fleet, Picard and the gang find a Borg megacube hiding in Jupiter's atmosphere which is the source of the signal controlling the fleet. They have two objectives: find and destroy the signal beacon, and rescue Jack. Riker and Worf discover that the beacon is at the heart of the cube, and the Enterprise will have to navigate a circuitous route through the cube to get there. Meanwhile, Picard finds Jack, but he's now a Borg drone who is coordinating the attack on Earth. Also there is a scarred and broken Borg Queen, who says that the Borg's future won't be through assimilation, but evolution. Meanwhile, Seven and Raffi manage to retake control of the Titan and they make a few strafing runs against the assimilated fleet.<span class="spoilerContent"> Alas, they are unable to prevent the destruction of the Earth starbase, leaving the planet defenseless. Now at the center of the cube, the Enterprise crew determine that destroying the beacon will destroy the cube, and they can't get a lock on Picard or Jack to beam them to safety.

							<div class="spoilerContent"><p>Naturally, at the last second, Picard is able to break the Queen's control over Jack, Troi is able to telepathically locate them and beam them back to the ship, and the Enterprise flies triumphantly away as the cube explodes.

								<p>Please bear with me for two paragraphs while I make an analogy. Are you familiar with the 2004 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgeball:_A_True_Underdog_Story" target="_blank"><em>Dodgeball</em></a>? If not, I guess I'm going to spoil the ending for you here. The original ending to the movie, which never made it to theaters, was purposely made to be darkly comedic. After a movie-long rivalry between two competing gyms, everything was set up for the Average Joes (the good guys) to win the tournament against GloboGym (the bad guys). At the very last minute, White Goodman (bad guy) succeeds in effecting a shocking reversal, securing the win for GloboGym. There is a minute or two of anguished looks from the Average Joes and a slo-mo celebration by GloboGym, and then it cuts directly to the credits. Well, test audiences hated this ending, of course. After all, nobody wants the bad guys to win, even if it is meant to be dark humor.</p>
								
								<p>And so, the ending was changed so that the good guys would win &ndash; but that's not all. Slightly miffed that their original ending didn't test well, they wrote the new ending to be an over-the-top super-win for the Average Joes. <em>Not only</em> do they win the tournament and the $50,000 prize, but it turns out that Peter La Fleur (good guy) took a $100,000 bribe from GloboGym and bet on his own team winning. At 50-1 odds, he's earned another $5 million. <em>Not only</em> that, but his winnings are delivered in what is essentially a treasure chest emblazoned with the words &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina" target="_blank">Deus Ex Machina</a>.&rdquo; <em>Not only</em> that, but the $5 mil is enough for him to buy the controlling stake of GloboGym, effectively making him White Goodman's boss, and allowing him to retain ownership of Average Joe's gym, which he had sold to GloboGym earlier. <em>And if all that wasn't enough</em>, Peter's love interest not only finally shows interest in him, but she turns out to be bisexual, introducing him to another beautiful woman, implying future threesome action! There's even a post-credits scene decrying the desire for audiences to just be entertained and not have to think too much or appreciate complexity.</p>
								
								<p>Now, why, you ask, did I bring that up now, on my review of the series finale of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>? Can you guess? I hope it's obvious. This episode is the over-the-top super-finale that fans demanded since this series began. There was especially a lot of dislike for Season 2, which required some appreciation of complexity and depth. No, all the fans wanted was to see the crew from <em>The Next Generation</em> back together on the bridge of the Enterprise&#8209;D, flying around with phasers firing and explosions and victory and maybe some bisexuals. Well, they finally got it. </p>
								
								<div class="spoilerPlaceholder"><p>( additional spoiler content hidden )</p></div>
								
								<div class="spoilerContent">
								<p>So, <em>not only</em> are we facing a Borg cube again, but this time, it's a megacube! Hundreds of times larger than anything we've previously seen! <em>Not only</em> was Jack assimilated, but he's made to look just like Locutus! <em>Not only</em> does the Enterprise have to fly around the outside of the cube avoiding phaser fire in an impressive CGI firestorm, but to save the galaxy, they have to go <em>inside</em> the cube and take a <em>comically circuitous</em> route to find the beacon! Phasers firing! 'Splosions 'sploding! <em>Not only</em> does Jack snap out of it and disconnect himself from the hive mind, but he does it because of the POWER OF FAMILIAL LOVE! Who knew that would be the Borg's true weakness?? <em>Not only</em> did they set up a no-win scenario where destroying the beacon would kill everyone on the cube including Picard, Riker, Worf, and Jack, but they destroyed the beacon and managed to save everyone, anyway, because Troi was able to locate them at the last minute using the POWER OF ROMANTIC LOVE!</p>
								
								<p>Not only did all our heroes save the day, but Beverly is promoted to Admiral and made Head of Starfleet Medical! Not only was Seven absolved of any wrongdoing during this whole fiasco, but it turns out that Shaw liked her all along and had recommended her for promotion to captain! Not only was Raffi vindicated, but her entire family suddenly wants her to be a part of their lives again! Everybody has a cloyingly-wonderful happy ending! I think maybe this was the &ldquo;saccharine song&rdquo; that Moriarty was talking about in an earlier episode. All it was missing was someone wheeling in a treasure chest labeled &ldquo;Deus Ex Machina&rdquo; and full of money.</p>
								
								<p>Now, don't get me wrong &ndash; it's not like I wanted any sadness for the ending. I think it's wonderful that everyone gets to come out of this alive, laughing and smiling around the poker table. <em>Especially</em> after the writers sort of disingenuously and heavily implied that <em>someone</em> was going to die in a few of the scenes in this episode. The way that Riker and Troi looked at each other before he left the ship, the way that Picard said &ldquo;It's been an honor serving with you all&rdquo; before he left the ship, and Picard's last words to Riker and Worf before they parted ways on the Borg cube &ndash; all of these were set up to make us believe that someone wasn't coming out of this crisis alive.</p>
								
								<p>One of the weird things at the end was Data in therapy sessions with Deanna. The reason it seems a little weird is because they deleted at least two scenes that better explained how Data was struggling slightly with his newfound emotions &ndash; these emotions that include some of Lore's anger and suspicion, and these emotions which he can't just &ldquo;turn off&rdquo; any more.</p>
								
								<p>I wish they had done just a <em>little bit more</em> with the Enterprise, though. If you're going to go to the trouble of bringing back the D, show us something new that <em>TNG</em> didn't have the budget for. The main shuttlebay, perhaps? Cetacean Ops? Or at least separate the ship again, that was the D's whole <em>thing</em>!</p>
								
								<p>Anyway, even if it is a bit over-the-top, it's still a good finale, overall. The good guys win, the bad guys are dead, all conflict is resolved, and then they get drunk and play poker. What more could you ask for?  ...oh, what's that? You want a post-credits scene teasing something new, as well? <em>WELL YOU'RE IN LUCK...</em></p>

		<p>Season 3 of <em>Star Trek: Picard</em> delivers on what the fans demanded: the crew of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D, back together again &ndash; and it does so with style! They are still the characters we love, but with 20 more years of experience, and that experience has changed them and made them grow. Beverly has clearly &ldquo;seen some things&rdquo; and is ready and willing to kick some ass. Riker and Troi are back with a little bit of new drama. Geordi has settled down and become a family man. Even Data is back... Data 3.0, now with more emotion! And Worf, well... one thing that was a definite improvement with this season was the lack of Jurati- or Elnor-style comedy relief. Instead, our comedy relief comes from a most unexpected source: Worf. And it is <em>amazing</em>. The straight-faced delivery of his lines is comedy gold.</p>

		<p>Seven and Raffi are back this season, and it's great to see them both alongside our TNG heroes. Seven sports a Starfleet uniform (it's about time!) and Raffi makes up one-half of an amazing duo along with Worf. It says a lot for <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Michelle_Hurd" target="_blank">Michelle Hurd</a> that her character is the only &ldquo;new&rdquo; character to make it all the way to Season 3. Speaking of new characters, we have some truly enjoyable performances this season from <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Todd_Stashwick" target="_blank">Todd Stashwick</a> as Captain Liam Shaw and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Amanda_Plummer" target="_blank">Amanda Plummer</a> as Captain Vadic. Shaw, as I talked about above, is a real jerk to our heroes, and yet somehow there is still something likable about him. And I can't say enough about Vadic wonderfully filling the role of a classic <em>Trek</em> villain.</p>
		
		<p>I haven't said much about <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ed_Speleers" target="_blank">Ed Speleers</a> as the young Jack Crusher up until now, but he certainly does a fine job of carrying the story and is a wonderful legacy for Picard. Speaking of legacies, the end of this story sort of seems like it's setting up the possibility for a new show. Fans speculated about a so-called &ldquo;<em>Star Trek: Legacy</em>&rdquo; that would star Captain Seven and Commander Raffi Musiker alongside the progeny of some of the greats: Jack Crusher, of course, Sidney and Elandra La Forge, perhaps even Soji and Kestra Riker-Troi? I thought about some other descendants that could make for some interesting guest appearances on the show: Alexander Rozhenko (son of Worf), Jake Sisko, the unnamed child of Ben Sisko and Kassidy Yates, Molly and Kirayoshi O'Brien, Naomi Wildman, Miral Paris (daughter of Tom and B'Elanna)... heck, there could be an episode that features Paris &amp; Janeway's lizard babies!</p>	
		
		<p>The end of this season was missing a scene, I think. I say that sort of tongue-in-cheek, because it's just one that I think would have been funny, but also delightful in that it would give us cameos from some other TNG characters. See, Picard has some explaining to do for poor Laris. I think he should have met with Laris, along with Beverly and Jack, and had to awkwardly explain that Jack is his son. Then Laris could have nodded sternly and said something like, &ldquo;Interesting, because I was just having a most illuminating conversation with another friend of yours,&rdquo; and then she turns to reveal <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Vash" target="_blank">Vash</a>. Then to just up the ridiculousness, a bunch of Picard's other former lovers start showing up. You know, maybe <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Nella_Daren" target="_blank">Nella Daren</a> comes by, along with <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kamala" target="_blank">Kamala</a>, just as <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Anij" target="_blank">Anij</a> pops up on the comm line. And now here's Picard surrounded by a bunch of his former love interests. Ha! I suppose this scene sort of flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test" target="_blank">Bechdel Test</a>, but I still think it would have been funny.</p>
		
		<p>Overall, this was a fantastic season in the tried-and-true style of a <em>Star Trek</em> space adventure. With a classic villain, nods to TNG's origins, and still plenty of new material, it rounds out the series nicely and gives a truly fitting end for the TNG crew, certainly a much better one than <a href="../films/nemesis.html"><em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em></a> left us with. For me, personally, the last episode of this season was all &ldquo;frosting,&rdquo; though. To quote Harry Kim, &ldquo;It's sort of like a steady diet of dessert, which is fine, but pretty soon you want some meat and potatoes.&rdquo; Still, fans ate it up, so who am I to disagree? With the whole gang back together, this season must take the top spot: First Place out of this series' three seasons.</p>
